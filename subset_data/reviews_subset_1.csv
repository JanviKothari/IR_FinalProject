6160803,32623175,2015-05-19,30267003,Ann,"My family and I are very pleased with the accommodation of the the place. It is very clean, comfortable and  well equipped. The location is convenient as well. "
6160803,33936513,2015-06-02,4396826,Robert Marshall,"Thomas and Jenny's place provided us with a wonderful and comfortable home base from which to operate during our visit to Boston. The home was spacious, clean, centrally located and thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend it highly, especially for larger groups."

6160803,35353758,2015-06-17,2877170,Jc,"My friends and I love our stay and love the space.  It was a nice change after so many days at a hotel.  It was a nice quiet neighborhood but it doesn't seem like the best part of town.  Jenny is very prompt at responding to every question.  Very lovely front yard.  Though, 10 am check out was a little too early for us... Overall, I'd still recommend this place."
6160803,35475913,2015-06-19,4607064,Gautier,"We really enjoyed our stay at Thomas & Jenny's place. Evrything was as described on the listing.
We didn't stayed much in the neighborhood during the day but it doesn't seem to be the most touristic place :) So, make sure you have a car or take public transportation to go to downtown Boston.

Thanks again for hosting us :)"
6160803,35837440,2015-06-22,34584185,Steven,"The host is super polite, and all instructions and house rules are very clearly laid out.  More importantly, is is the best house we ever booked for our 10-people church retreat / gathering!  The house is in a super great location, 5 gorgeous bed rooms with 3 queen-size beds and 4 single beds.  The neighborhood is very quite and calm, and we used the fantastic kitchen for our lunch and dinner cooking.  There are many other choices in Boston area, but I will say this is the best one I'm ever seen.  If my church is doing another retreat, we will definitely come back to book this house again!  Both bathrooms are super clean and tidy.  Couch area is wonderfully comfortable for group chatting and playing board games.  The nice huge patio on the first floor is another perfect place for group discussion / activity / prayer!  We even leveraged the dim sum (3-min walk) nearby for one of our lunches!  Cannot think of a better place than this lovely house to host a 10-people event!"
6160803,36018318,2015-06-24,32534106,John,"We had the most amazing time while our stay in Boston.  The house was more then the pictures and other reviews wrote about.  Thomas and Jenny are great hosts who answered all our questions.  The house is very clean and a great place to stay that is a quick drive to the city.

Would surely stay here again if we ever go back to Boston and would recommend the house to our friends."
6160803,36405364,2015-06-28,27146046,Mona And Trond Hovland,"We were two families – 9 persons - staying here for a few days, and we had a great time. The house was very well equipped. We loved the big and airy rooms with very good beds. Everything was new, nice and tidy. We had a great stay in Boston, and we will recommend this house to any families og groups of friends going to Boston."
6160803,37071500,2015-07-04,23749481,James,"We had a great time in Boston and Thomas and Jenny's lovely home contributed to that, There place is very clean,very spacious and everything is in working order. The parking is ideal and it's location is  easy to get to downtown Boston and the various interstates. Their place is quiet and the yard is very nice, and the kitchen is nice and having a easy to use washer and dryer made things nice (We travel with three kiddos) The beds were almost to comfy.  I suggest bringing an alarm.  As we were rushing to catch our flight, I couldn't find the email with the lock box code . In a rush i texted Jenny asking for the code, literally within the minute she replied back and away we went. Talk about great communication when I needed it most. Thank you~"
6160803,37351530,2015-07-06,35330735,Ryan,"A group of us stayed here for the July 4th weekend and had an amazing experience. We had never used Airbnb before and were overly pleased with the accommodations provided. The house was very clean and had everything we needed, all of our inquiries were quickly responded too and the entire experience was very simple and easy and we were all happy that we had stayed here rather than a hotel.
The only issue we did have (and is in no way a reflection to the property) was getting a taxi. We were told that taxi's don't come to the area often and even when we called multiple times, we waited hours and the drivers didn't even know where Fenway Park was and wanted us (tourists) to direct them. 
I highly recommend staying here and using Uber if you do want to take your own vehicle into the city, it worked wonders.
Again, amazing experience. If we travel back to Boston  we would 100% stay here again."
6160803,38277278,2015-07-14,33108511,Shannon,"This was a very nice apartment and super convenient for my family since it was only minutes away from my family in Dorchester. It was fully equipped with just about everything we needed, very clean, spacious, and the neighbors were really nice. We would definitely stay here again."
6160803,38858477,2015-07-19,34790023,Michael,"This ended up being a perfect rental for our business trip. Each one of our team members had their own bedroom, and the space was clean and comfortable for everyone. The home is within walking distance of the T, which we made good use of. Most of our trip was spent around the harbor/financial district, so we didn't spend much time in the neighborhood around the home, but it seemed like there were enough businesses within walking distance of the home that it would have been convenient to pick up takeout or groceries had we needed. My colleagues and I may come back to Boston for other business, and if we do I would not hesitate at all to stay here again. "
6160803,39378957,2015-07-23,31693701,Kelli,"A group of 8 (4 adults, 4 children) stayed here for 3 days in July.  The house was very clean and well equipped.  We had plenty of room.  The upstairs room of the apartment is a great place for kids to play without having to worry about bothering anyone downstairs. Thomas and Jenny were great hosts and very responsive.  A minor issue was addressed extremely quickly.  Would stay here again!"
6160803,39622247,2015-07-25,33915369,Jenny,We really enjoyed our time at this house in Dorchester.  Everything was exactly as the pictures showed it to be.  The house was immaculate and had everything that you could need.  The T stop was about a 15-20 minute walk.  The owners were very responsive to our questions.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.
6160803,39786802,2015-07-26,36060066,William,"The apartment was as described, very nice, good communications, would recommend highly to anyone going to Boston, or to Fenway Park for a game like we did."
6160803,39976379,2015-07-27,14188296,Aaron,House was great. Awesome location. Place was very nice and take care of. Absolutely great place to stay in Boston.
6160803,42179245,2015-08-11,38199160,Kristina,Jenny was fantastic! She got back to me quickly whenever I emailed her. The apartment was clean and awesome. Everything we needed. Thank you so much! We would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Boston! 
6160803,44552138,2015-08-27,2245051,Dave,Thomas and Jenny were quick to respond to inquires about the space and worked with me to settle our group in our accommodations. The pictures represented the listing well and we were incredibly pleased with the amenities provided to us. The neighborhood was a little difficult to navigate due to the small streets (FYI if you are driving in using a big vehicle)
6160803,45497141,2015-09-03,40970256,Yiqing,"This house provided us everything we needed during our stay. We had total of 7 people stayed there for a week. The apartment looked exactly the same as shown on the website. Spacious living area along with a fully equipped modern kitchen, everything was just beyond our expectations. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. And Jenny the landlord, she is very responsive. She answered all of our questions quickly and patiently. Overall, me and my family were more than satisfied to stay in Jenny's apartment. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who  is looking for a comfy  home to stay in Boston. "
6160803,47155901,2015-09-16,1514836,Fernando,"The house was neat and clean, very big and comfortable. It had everything we needed and more.  We recommend it for big families traveling together.  The neighborhood is quiet, nice and safe. Groceries stores nearby, train station a 10 minutes walk away, so very convenient.  We really enjoyed our time in Boston! "
6160803,48990380,2015-09-30,36569355,Tera,"Thomas and Jenny were great to work with and quick to answer any of my questions, even while staying at their home.  It was nice to stay in a local neighborhood to get the real feel of living in the Boston area.  It was close to the T and also just an Uber drive away from everything.  "
6160803,49772278,2015-10-06,7802535,Ryan,Thomas and Jenny provided a carefree stay in their beautiful home. Arrival and leaving were seamless and our family loved all being together in one place. All was very clean and we needed nothing. I would certainly stay here again.
6160803,49971147,2015-10-08,33687355,Pat,"Loved our two days / two nights at Thomas and Jenny's place.  Perfect for four, retired couples traveling together.  Close to Boston area venues. Nice kitchen and dining / living room.  Comfortable and clean.  Great place for an extended family reunion or larger party of 8-10.  We'd stay here again!!  "
6160803,50456249,2015-10-12,22011449,Cindy,"The listing was nicer then pictures show. The house is a lovely older updated centerhall style home. (Beautifully restored wood floors!) The unit we stayed in was the second and third floor. It was perfect for my family which was in from all over for my daughter's wedding. And it was quite, too. The parking was easy (two places in the driveway) and plenty free on the street. The location offers easy access to Boston and the neighborhood is safe.  I highly recommend this for business groups or extended families."
6160803,50811869,2015-10-14,46109316,Nao,"5ベッドルームすべてを貸し切る形で友人含めて10人で利用しました。シングルベッド2つのお部屋が一つ、2段ベッドの部屋が一つ、クイーンサイズベッド一つのお部屋が三つでしたので、男女が一緒に使う場合は参考にしてください。
リビングダイニングとキッチンはとても広くて快適でした。キッチンは今回使いませんでしたが、食器やカトラリー、鍋等そろっています。チェックインの時間が夜の10時くらいになってしまい、頂いていたキーナンバーで入れなかったのですが、電話をしたらすぐに対応して頂けました。なお、ダウンタウンからは電車で20分くらいです。家から駅までは12分ほど歩きますが、特に問題は感じませんでした。おすすめしたいお家です。
"
6160803,52091561,2015-10-26,19069176,Simon,The apartment was spacious and accommodating. We stayed for our business trip and it suited our needs. Approximately 20 minutes to the Hynes Convention Center. 
6160803,55018948,2015-11-27,48005738,H,So good. Give me a good traveled.
6160803,56032283,2015-12-08,4994061,Linda,"Thomas & Jenny both were a great host. Upon our arrival, the house was extremely clean and the beds were all very well made.  The house was fully stocked with kitchen utensils, a washer & dryer, and plenty of extra pillows to satisfy your comfort needs. The location was so convenient to us; we definitely appreciated how quiet the  neighborhood was and how there was plenty of parking spaces on the street. Overall, we had a wonderful stay. Thank you Thomas and Jenny for the hospitality.  "
6160803,58580914,2016-01-03,49132157,Keith,"This was a great place, a great stay. Very clean and comfortable. All the amenities were as advertised, spacious and attractive. And convenient to down town!

We had a couple of questions and our hosts were responsive and quick to provide answers. 

Very happy with our stay!! Everything was great."
6160803,61791363,2016-02-08,9642297,Murat,Hosts were great and the house was very nice and clean. Everything was as expected based on the descriptions. Not too far from subway so relatively easy to get into down town. Quite neighbourhood with a great cafe nearby (Dot2Dot).
6160803,64737068,2016-03-06,16640784,Justine,The house and location were perfect for our last minute trip to Boston! I highly recommend this wonderful home!
6160803,66401011,2016-03-22,55022027,Jillian,"The house was easy to find and close to a CVS, package store and restaurants. The space was very clean, nicely decorated, spacious and inviting. There was plenty of room for the seven of us to hang out in the main area. The yellow roses on the kitchen table was a lovely welcome. The bedrooms only have mini blinds (no curtains) so it is very sunny and bright in the morning- consider bringing an eye mask if you want to sleep in- I did and it was fine! We had such a fun trip and all wished we could have spent even more time at the house. Thomas and Jenny checked in with us on our second day to make sure we were all settled in which was considerate. I would definitely come back!"
6160803,68315455,2016-04-04,13959817,Jill,"The house was perfect for our group of 7 and would have been comfortable for up to 10.  It is very clean and just like shown in the pictures.  Being able to park 2 cars was great, and it was an easy 10 minute walk to the T.  I highly recommend this home and would definitely stay here if we travel to the Boston area again.  "
6160803,70866326,2016-04-21,38846538,Stacey And Nate,"Our stay in the Dorchester House worked out very well for our week long stay as we were in town for the Boston Marathon. The sleeping options fit our group of friends and family perfectly. The walk to the train at Fields Corners wasn't too bad. The keyless entry was perfect for our large group coming and going at different times. We made a decent amount of meals at the house to save money and all I really missed having was a cookie sheet and luckily I brought my own seasoning because this house doesn't have any. There is a nice pasta strainer not pictured in case anyone was wondering. If you do come with a larger group, take care to space out showering and possibly have some shower the night before. The hot water only goes so far. 
But despite that it was a great stay and a good experience. I would recommend it to other groups like ours. 
Thank you Thomas and Jenny

6160803,71655612,2016-04-27,68326236,Kevin,"Quiet neighborhood, accurate description.  There are two beds on the attic but they are pretty much only good for one person.  Condo was well equipped for cooking."
6160803,74485201,2016-05-15,22551957,Jose Alberto,"We stayed at this property in Dorchester, Boston for 7 days and it fulfilled our expectations.  We were a family of 8 members attending graduation ceremonies in Boston.  The apartment is located on the 2nd floor of a large home and it accomodated 8 persons in 3 bedrooms and 2 in the attic.  The apt. was clean and it looked exactly the same as what the photos portrayed. The kitchen has all the necessary utensils, washer, dryer, towels,  and everything you need.  We enjoyed the cleanliness, comfort and felt like at home.  The only inconvenience was the steep stairs both entering the apt. and going into the attic. especially since we had 3 senior citizens with health problems, still we managed to assist them while going up the stairs.  The apt. is well-aired and lighted, and the beds are comfortable.  The use of WC got a little busy in the morning since there are only two of them but we managed as well.  The area in Dorchester is safe and with easy access to and from downtown Boston and other areas.  I highly recommend this apt. for its cleanliness, size, and the frequent communication with the owner who is willing to assist any needs one has.  The parking space is shared with other tenants but the property has enough space to park several cars.  Quiet neighborhood. This property definitely honors the Airbnb policy of renting a home and feeling like part of that home, surroundings and environment.  Two thumbs up!"
6160803,75058752,2016-05-18,21543630,Beth,"A great value. This home accommodated seven women who traveled together to Boston for a board meeting and it cost our nonprofit a fraction of what we would have had to spend on hotel rooms. Easily accessible to downtown via Uber for roughly $15 each way. Clean, roomy and comfortable for our two-night stay. If we would stay here again, I'd want to remember to pack an extra hotel-sized soap (toiletries aren't provided) and a roll of toilet paper, as the owners request that you replace what is used. Note that this home is on the second floor; we didn't have a problem lugging our carry-on luggage up the steep flight of stairs, but with larger bags or frailer guests you may have difficulty."
6160803,75608898,2016-05-22,46744282,Diane,"This was a great vacation rental.  It was probably the cleanest vacation rental we have ever stayed in and in a very quiet neighborhood.  The setup as far as bedrooms and bathrooms was perfect for my family of seven adults.  When we initially had trouble locking up and called our hosts, they answered immediately and were very helpful.  Jenny also checked in with us on our second day to make sure we were doing okay.  The rental was exactly as described.  I wish I had re-read the previous reviews the week before we arrived so that I wouldn't have been surprised by the bright sunshine in the bedrooms each morning.  The kitchen is adequately supplied with cooking utensils but not what I would call a fully stocked kitchen, especially for a large group.  As another reviewer pointed out, if you have as many people staying as we did, you will want to space out the showers but we would have to do that at our home too.  It was also a little disconcerting after arriving to find that we had to immediately go to the store because there were only 2 partial rolls of toilet paper for the 2 bathrooms.  I knew we had to provide everything but I didn't think that was going to have to be our very first stop.  Parking was exactly as described but we didn't need the parking area since we utilized the subway.  "
6160803,76864883,2016-05-29,26025511,Hailey,"Not only were the pictures and descriptions accurate - but Jenny was an absolute pleasure to work with. Door keypad entry is genius and worked perfectly with our large group of 9 other girls going different places at different times. We had so much fun and would absolutely recommend both this place and it's hosts to anyone interested. 

"
6160803,78131199,2016-06-05,36290678,Adriene,"This was the perfect place for us! I had a large group of friends and family members, about 13 of us, coming for my son's graduation and I rented  both units. One on the first floor and the other one on the second,  Thomas and Jenny own both places.  The house is beautiful, spacious, well decorated, fully equipped, and very close to Boston and the subway station. It looks exactly like the pictures. Jenny was absolutely fabulous! Always prompt, kind, and generous. We were able to check in earlier which was a tremendous help, so I could get settled before the company arrived. I highly recommend this place, and I feel very fortunate to have found it!"
6160803,80541347,2016-06-18,65023421,Li,The place is clean and spacious. have a big garden and the location is convenient. Overall experience is excellent. 
6160803,82675371,2016-06-28,49175950,Jack,"It was a beautiful place for the 6 of us that traveled. Transit, convenience stores, & eateries were all within a 15 minute walk. "
6160803,83019584,2016-06-30,63665001,Tania,"This was a one night stopover for our group of 10 passing through Boston.  The house was charming, clean and comfortable. We ate at Chau Chow Chinese just down the road which was an easy, good value option after we arrived quite late. Didn't meet our hosts but they were helpful and readily available."
6160803,84120307,2016-07-05,57677392,Mary,"We were pleased with this AirBnB. We found the apartment well furnished, with appropriate amenities,  and reasonably priced. The starter kit was helpful. We very much enjoyed staying there.

However, our apartment was on the second floor of the home. The stairs to the apartment were very steep with only 6"" treads and caused problems for two of our group. In one case, a fall resulted in a bad ankle sprain.

We recommend that the landlord look at replacing the steps with wider treads and better banisters."
6160803,85872354,2016-07-13,16002758,Sarah,"We received an email providing us with all the necessary information regarding key codes and more well before checkin.  We found our place to be clean, airy, and spacious.  It was perfect for our needs."
6160803,86246481,2016-07-15,82175123,Michael,Good values for big family and friends traveling together.  Please is clean and spacious.
6160803,90323622,2016-07-31,23349003,LeAnn,"Thomas and Jenny's airbnb was a fantastic experience for my guests and I.  My mom, aunts, and cousins were in town for my bridal shower weekend and it was a great space for us all to gather with enough room for everyone to have their own space.  The unit was spacious, very clean, and had a stocked kitchen will all necessities.  "
6160803,96032519,2016-08-21,59662524,Yanxi,"It is an awesome house. We all like it very much. The rooms are very big and really clean. Also, the environment around it is also excellent. It was really a perfect experience."
6160803,97163822,2016-08-26,30354,Randall,As a group we felt comfortable and at home for the entire stay. The place clean and odor free.Walking distance to food and restaurants. Convention center 10 minutes by car. The host was available.   I would stay here again.
6160803,97814419,2016-08-28,59908935,Linda,"I had the place for my family who were visiting from Houston this past weekend for my wedding.  I do not how there stay was per se, but from walking in the first day after dropping them off, it was really amazing to see a well furnish place.  Pictures does not do the place justice.  Closed to everything and just a great place overall in Boston."
6160803,103036350,2016-09-20,75225306,Simon,"This property was used as part of a two week family holiday to the US. We used hotels in NY and decided to use Airbnb in Boston.

There are definitely pros and some cons here. Firstly the size, lots of space, building consists of two floors. We occupied the upper floor which had great space including 3 double bedrooms and two rooms with two single beds, one of which was a bunk. Good lounge area, with a large TV and Internet. The kitchen is fully fitted with cooking and laundry facilities. The whole apartment is spotless, it's cleanliness was notable. We would have to say though that the slatted beds are creaky. 

It's location is a 10 min walk to the T transport which is only a few stops from the centre of Boston, around $5 round trip. The local area around the property doesn't offer much, but we had planned to be away most of the day sightseeing. We did however decide to use Uber to return to the property to avoid the local T station at night, around $10-15. We did consider taking our hire car but parking in Boston was difficult or expensive."
6160803,103631924,2016-09-23,60801624,Катерина,Jenny была отличной хозяйкой. Хороший чистый комфортный дом. Все было замечательно. Немного далековато от центра. Но в остальном все было замечательно.
6160803,104925832,2016-09-29,4321466,Yuan,"The house is very spacious, well furnished, and was well liked by our group.  It is located close to CVS, an alcohol store, and a grocery store for easy access to food.  We used uber and lyft to travel to downtown Boston and they were easy to get in this area.  We would highly recommend this location to future travelers."
6160803,106231426,2016-10-04,67211594,Simon,"We travelled over from the UK for a family reunion and celebration.  Finding somewhere that can accommodate 8 adults comfortably isn't easy, but the house was great for this.  It's a bit further out if the city than we'd ideally like, but it's only a 10-minute walk to Fields Corner on the T, so this wasn't a problem.  There are places to eat and buy groceries nearby.  There's lots of space, and the neighbourhood is safe. Great for large groups like ours. Thomas and Jenny were easy to deal with and sorted the one problem that arose promptly. "
6160803,107168976,2016-10-09,86510886,Robert,"This place worked out very well for our group of 3 senior couples. We found it to be clean, comfortable, well-maintained and quiet. Although it is a ways from downtown Boston, we found the bus and rail system to be a convenient and inexpensive way to get around. The house is only about one block from a bus stop, and the bus ride to the rail station was only about 10 minutes. We occasionally had to wait 15 or 20 minutes for the next bus.  There were some limited shopping and dining options within a 15-minute or so walk which wasn't real convenient for us. The kitchen is small but functional. We didn't want to do any cooking other than breakfast anyway, so the kitchen was more than adequate for that. "
6160803,108551017,2016-10-16,39478088,Shawn,A perfect place a large group.
6160803,110489338,2016-10-26,1012372,Jennifer,Lots of room for our group. Was great having parking on site. Thomas and Jenny were very responsive. 
6160803,111819203,2016-11-01,14054588,Geraint,"Thanks very much for making the place available, it was a lovely place. 10minutes from the metro so easy to get into central Boston but the house is in a quiet area that doesn't suffer from prices in central Boston. We hope to be back next year so will try to rebook."
6160803,113237816,2016-11-11,2787154,Carman,Thomas & Jenny's place was ideal for our group of 5 co-workers traveling to Boston for a conference. Spacious. Clean. Quiet. Recommended.

6160803,120441708,2016-12-10,31314568,Marie,"Great place for a business team to stay while traveling - privacy for all, well kept kitchen and bathrooms.  Clean, quiet.  We have returned for more than one trip and booked both units in the house."
6160803,122876087,2016-12-26,908372,Jennifer,Great home with plenty of space! 
6160803,132544589,2017-02-18,116614751,Damon,Very nice host and very clean house!
6160803,143140345,2017-04-10,48972077,Courtenay,Great stay and perfect location
6160803,143828808,2017-04-13,123758916,Patricia,The place was very clean and spacious. Having a designated parking spot was extremely helpful and it  was an easy trip to downtown.  The contact between Thomas and Jenny was seemless.  Would definitely recommend this place.
6160803,145517525,2017-04-18,7510593,Susan,"The things I liked:
• we could store luggage in a closet in the entryway before checkin and after checkout
• there were enough beds to sleep 10 people comfortably
• my family came for the Boston Marathon, and this property fit our needs
• enough plates and pots to cook a pasta dinner the night before the race
• grocery store within walking distance
• public transit is 0.6 miles away. We didn't rent a car.
• Thomas & Jenny quickly responded to emails 

Things I disliked:
• two of the queen beds were old with loud springs (think waking up in the middle of the night when you move)
• you're expected to replenish household items when they run out. There were only a few plastic bags for the trash, and we ran out quickly. There was only enough dish detergent for one load of dishes and only enough laundry detergent for one load of clothes. We didn't feel like we should have to replenish things that were almost empty to begin with. 
• Dorchester, the area where the property is located, is sketchy. 
• there was a used sucker stick on the floor when we arrived 
• there weren't any sponges or brushes to clean the dishes with 
• there weren't basic cooking supplies like salt or pepper

I've stayed in worse Airbnb's and I've stayed in better. This one was average. "
6160803,149643433,2017-05-05,92168545,Damien,"This accommodation is great. There were 6 of us staying here & we had loads of space, all the basics were there, including bedding & towels which were all very clean. We also had a private parking space for our car. The accommodation is in a great location, it is close to Boston city centre & the airport and it is also very close to numerous convenient stores.  "
6160803,155161705,2017-05-27,30149566,Isabella,Very spacious. Great house!
6160803,156641030,2017-05-31,76249675,Melanie,"The house was perfect for our family of 9. It afforded a perfect amount of privacy as well as common living spaces. We could hang out together if we wanted and get some private space when we wanted as well. There are numerous restaurants nearby within walking distance as well as a grocery store for supplies. The apartment is spacious with an interesting layout that delighted us. Their was a friendly neighbor who said good morning to us every day on our walk to the train. The only potential issue would be with accessible. It is up a flight of stairs with more steps in the apartment. Not a problem for us, but might be for those with limited mobility. Thomas and Jenny were great hosts. They responded to any questions or requests very quickly, even bringing us a new coffee maker when we had trouble. I would recommend this apartment as well as Thomas and Jenny."
6160803,159228209,2017-06-10,103166553,Barbara,Thomas and Jenny were helpful with any confusion or directions. Stores were a little difficult without a car. T into the city was pretty easy to follow good time have by all:)
6160803,159803485,2017-06-11,42583384,Yu,"性价比很高,房东很Nice,沟通也很好,给予高评价!"
6160803,160467908,2017-06-14,118968513,Justin,"We were a large group of 10 adults visiting Boston for 3 days. So this was a very nice size for us all. 5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, dining area/lounge and garden with balcony. Also, 2 free car parking spaces on the drive and free road parking if needed.
Communication was excellent before our stay, and check in was easy and straight forward. All rooms were clean and well equipped. Very good value for money, and nice we were all able to stay together.
Location for getting into Boston centre was reasonable. 15 min walk to the T station, and 20-30 mins on train, depending where you wanted to go. Major delays on tracks 2 days coming back home in evenings but that wasn't to be known.
Shops and restaurants nearby.
All in all, well recommended
"
6160803,162067409,2017-06-19,78185153,Jan,bedrooms great   well equipped kitchen
6160803,163312171,2017-06-24,6099032,Katie,"When we arrived in the house, there were some electricity issues and several rooms were without power. Jenny was responsive and the electrician came and fixed the problem early the next morning.

The numbers of rooms is helpful to accommodate a larger group. Three of the rooms have comfortable beds while two of the rooms with queen beds were incredibly squeaky and uncomfortable. Some of our party actually preferred the blow up mattress we brought to the actual bed. 

There were minimal supplies in the house, including paper towels. And there is no railing to protect the stairs in the kitchen - so if you have small children, bring a baby gate or be cautious of that area of the kitchen. 

Lastly, the location was helpful; super close to the T and a playground. 
"
6160803,169314722,2017-07-12,26079263,Maria,Great apartment. Close to train station. Perfect for a large group.
6160803,172666006,2017-07-21,114585095,Jeanie,"Very clean and comfortable top floor apartment of a beautiful house. Access to the garden and a playground a short walk away is great for kids. I just wish the beds weren't so creaky and that the house was in more of a 'walking suburb'. Otherwise, I very much recommend. "
6160803,176255483,2017-07-30,12390929,Kirsten,The home was perfect for our trip!
6160803,177991878,2017-08-04,121368852,Sarai,This house was great for our extended family vacation. We had plenty of room to each have our own room. When we arrived one of the neighbors came over to greet us which was really nice. The added bonus of having off street parking was a huge win!
6160803,182798221,2017-08-15,118592098,Janet,"Spacious and roomy! Sufficient supplies- towels, dish ware and cleaning supplies. Check out rules are very detailed."
6160803,184913808,2017-08-20,93217146,David,Thomas and Jenny were easy to work with and their place was exactly as described.  Great location just south of boston with easy access to the T.   Wonderful little neighborhood and a great place with lots of character.  Would recommend the location and working with Thomas and Jenny.
6160803,187209435,2017-08-26,82082936,益萍,"房子还不错吧,离地铁有点距离,空调比较老,燥音大"
6160803,195191581,2017-09-18,121338540,Marcele,The unit was great for being able to have our family together in one location with enough beds for everyone!  There was enough space that everyone had privacy.  We enjoyed the main living room where we gathered together and chatted about our day!
14868157,100140251,2016-09-07,19778945,Chaomin,"Glad to be the first one to this list. Thank you so much, Lori!"
14868157,100482739,2016-09-09,19778945,Chaomin,"One of the BEST AIRBNB experience I have ever had. As a spontaneous traveler, I gladly accepted Lori's offer to stay for two extra days. It turned out to be a great decision. Lori is a great host, really dedicated. She gave great advice for my trip and was always helpful. 
The room is organized and well-decorated. The whole aesthetic of the interior design goes by its exterior — Victorian style with modern hint. It's homey and I love it very much! 
The location is also great. JP neighborhood is artsy and genuine. I enjoyed my time in Ula cafe. The Orange Line is very convenient, if you want to explore Boston. 
Highly recommended!
"
14868157,100985188,2016-09-11,90845829,Thibault,"I really liked the place, it's cozy and clean. Also lori is a very good host, i would definitely go back and will recommend to place to friends going to boston."
14868157,101849018,2016-09-15,45705944,Brittany,"Lori was a fantastic host, and I could not have asked for more for my first airbnb experience. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the house was beautiful, and the host was inviting. Lori had fruit, yogurt, and other breakfast items available for her guests as well as organic shampoos, conditioners, and soaps. Lori was also very accommodating- she brought me an iron and ironing board so I could press my clothes before my interview. If I am ever in need of a place to stay in Boston again, I would stay here 100 times over."
14868157,102270208,2016-09-17,18590010,Maria,"Charming home with a genuine caring hostess. My first experience with AirBnb as a guest and certainly not my last.  This speaks volume of Lori and how she makes her guests feel right at home. If available I would continue to make this my home base when visiting Boston. 

Uber wasn't  expensive to and from Boston University ($11-12).  The transit was a little confusing but a relatively short walk from Lori's home, making it convenient.

My favorite part of her home was the garden and balcony.  It started my day just right. 

I would refer Lori to my friends and family. 

"
14868157,102601072,2016-09-18,94184081,Shimon,"Lori really enjoys doing this and it shows. I normally don't sleep well the first night in a ""strange"" bed, but I did this time. 

The parking is super easy right in front of the house. 

Lori has paid a lot of attention to detail, labeling things in an unambiguous way. She has turned a charming old house into a very inviting place. I'll definitely be staying there again, when the occasion calls for it."
14868157,103099141,2016-09-20,93641956,Kevin,Good spot close enough to Transit for central Boston. Nice clean room in shared property with a charming host.
14868157,103628150,2016-09-23,33187835,Joanna,"I had a great stay here - Lori was very welcoming and it was lovely home. Soft towels, good breakfast, comfortable bed and excellent travel advice from Lori. She even gave me sun lotion!"
14868157,104153447,2016-09-25,5956854,Kathrin,"My stay at lori's was great. The house is so charming and makes you feel at home instantly. The room offered plenty of space and breakfast on the porch was a real treat. 
Parking was very easy and convenient, and you can get to the city within a few minutes.
Would highly recommend to stay with Lori. "
14868157,104805174,2016-09-28,87509436,Andre,The room is as described and clean. The neighbourhood is calm and the place is easy to find. I had a very kind contact to Lori. She is helpful and can give you good tips. I recommend with place.
14868157,105347740,2016-10-01,95176455,Lauren,Lori was a wonderful host and made me feel so comfortable while I was in Boston. The house is absolutely adorable. I would highly recommend staying here. 
14868157,106159162,2016-10-04,65120465,Kelli,"Lori was very welcoming and showed me around her house right away. The room and location were accurate. It was really convenient to get to the T from her house as well as some nearby places to eat and the Sam Adams Brewery. She provided coffee, tea, and breakfast items as well as bathroom items, all of which were very nice. "
14868157,106341956,2016-10-05,22008747,Stephanie,Great space. Clean and interesting house with an old-world charm. Lori was incredibly helpful
14868157,106677497,2016-10-07,61379972,Seo Yeong,"I really liked the room!! The room was just as described. It was actually more prettier than I thought. Even better than low level hotels.

One bad thing was the location. If it had been a bit closer to the central Boston area, it might have been superb.
But still, the neighborhood was safe and I really liked the room a lot. "
14868157,107175985,2016-10-09,8827134,Cristina,"I got this room for my husband who was going to Boston's 1/2 marathon. Communication with Lori was easy. She made sure we had all the information he needed for his arrival. My husband told me the location was perfect.  Walking distance to Sam Adam's brewery which he enjoyed a lot :) Everything was very clean. Lori was so nice to have food for breakfast, such as cereal, organic fruits, coffee,  tea, and the list goes on.  He didn't mention anything negative about the place. Thanks Lori!"
14868157,107481006,2016-10-10,4412169,Yan,"Absolutely charming.  Even better than the picture and possibly one of my top AirBNB experiences.  It has the feel of a classic New England boarding house w/ lots of cute little touches and flourishes.  Lori was super friendly and communicative and provided an abundance of breakfast options and travel guides.  Had never been to the neighborhood before but I really love Jamaica Plain --- lots of pretty and stately victorian houses, a feeling of community, fun things to do.  It was clear that Lori has put a lot of thought into creating a great AirBNB experience -- everything was where you would want it to be and there were neat little systems like color-coded labels for if you wanted to mark your food in the house fridge.  Loved it, would come back. "
14868157,107953007,2016-10-13,86571889,Rareș,I loved everything about this place! everything was as listed and Lori is such a kind and wonderful woman ! It was such a pleasure staying here. definately would reccomend to others as well!
14868157,108285895,2016-10-15,23910258,Lisa,Lori is always an excellent host. The room is cozy and comfortable. She makes excellent coffee and provides snacks in the kitchen. The house is a short walk from the T and the neighborhood is walkable with lots of cute houses. There's a great Mexican place nearby and a very cute cafe near the brewery which is about 10-15 minute walk. I highly recommend the listing. 
14868157,108820337,2016-10-17,97155736,Lacie,"Lori was so gracious and lovely to talk to! Like the other reviews say - the place is really cute/charming, things are clearly labeled, and check-in was easy. Breakfast is provided, and the house has everything you would need as if you were at home.  I will definitely stay here again!"
14868157,109265039,2016-10-20,31208429,Marie-Annick,"For my first time ever using Airbnb I did not know what to expect and was a bit worried (is it going to be clean, will I feel like I'm in someone else's stuff?...) but Lori made me feel home! I would even send my grandmother alone to Lori's place! Would recommmend her place to anyone!! Thank you Lori!! "
14868157,110159718,2016-10-24,93641956,Kevin,Great short stop over again. Thanks Lori.
14868157,111925597,2016-11-02,92934824,Jack,"Lori  is the perfect AirBnB host. We got along soooo well and I really enjoyed the breakfasts, banana cake, Halloween party and most of all the chat.  It was so much better that staying in a hotel or impersonal guesthouse. Lori's house is really warm and inviting and her hospitality is second to none. Would really recommend."
14868157,112294370,2016-11-05,15088699,Maureen,"Lori's place is so nice, exactly as described, easy to get to and not far from the train. The area is quite and lovely, I was there in the fall, so the colours of the trees was amazing. As an Australian, I cannot quite get over seeing squirrels everywhere, they are very cute, but apparently not in your roof. Take the time to walk out to the ponds, a very beautiful area. Lori is a very friendly and generous host, sharing a meal and wine with me on my first night at her place, it was very much appreciated. My last comment is that it is better to stay in the suburbs and learn about local places, you can still have time for all the tourist traps."
14868157,113015537,2016-11-09,16961526,Daniel,"Came in late, and left very early so I didn't get the opportunity to meet Lori. But that speaks to how great of a host she is. Everything I needed for the overnight stay was provided to me without me even having to ask (wifi info, extra blanket, towel, code to the front door, ect.) Very clean room in a cozy house. This is a top quality Airbnb, and I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area. Lori, I'm sorry we couldn't meet but if I'm ever in the area again and need to stay a night, I'll be sure to look for your Airbnb."
14868157,113255830,2016-11-11,102783272,Hazel,"Lori was a wonderful host and I felt very welcome at her beautiful home :) my room was charming,neat, clean, quiet, well-furnished, cozy and comfortable. The bathroom had a beautifully hand-painted wood floor and a cool claw-foot bath tub and the water pressure was awesome. I really enjoyed my stay here :) "
14868157,113382584,2016-11-12,20419026,Katie,"I loved my stay at Lori's house! Everything was exactly as described. My room was cozy, comfy, and indeed charming. The whole house was beautiful and easily accessible from the Orange Line train. I enjoyed talking with Lori and finding out more about her photography business and the Boston area. Breakfast was an added bonus, too! I definitely hope to stay here again next time I visit Boston - one of my best Airbnb experiences yet."
14868157,113948716,2016-11-14,14860454,John,"Lori's place is a nice house with plenty of character, in an interesting neighbourhood. It is extremely well-kept, and Lori has put plenty of notes around the house to explain everything.

She's got quite a bit of area knowledge as well. Highly recommended to stay!"
14868157,115180575,2016-11-22,94716748,Naho,The place is cozy&lovely and she is so kind about everything! I really liked this place and would love to stay again if I came back to Boston :)
14868157,125401112,2017-01-05,63600424,Mukesh,Perfect and wonderful place and host.
14868157,125572507,2017-01-06,23910258,Lisa,Great as always! The room is very cozy. 
14868157,126793401,2017-01-14,10731415,Ellie,"Lori's place is incredible. Beautiful home with unique details, like beautifully hand painted bathroom floor.  The room was spacious, bright and clean. Huge sunny kitchen. Lori is an absolute gem and a wonderful host! I will stay here again next time I'm in Boston. "
14868157,127207062,2017-01-16,74446183,Megan,"This place was perfect!
I needed to find lodging last minute and Lori's home was the perfect find!
Her home is warm and inviting.  The bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen were clean and cozy.  I could have stayed there forever.
The house is located about a 7 minute walk to the ""T"" line which gives you easy, inexpensive transportation to most spots in the Boston area.
I wouldn't hesitate to book with Lori again.
"
14868157,128655906,2017-01-26,23910258,Lisa,"I almost always stay at Lori's when I go to Boston. She's very friendly. The house is cute, comfortable and quiet. Good wifi, good hot water, and great coffee. "
14868157,130382845,2017-02-05,55700032,Rafael Esteban,Very quiet and comfortable.

14868157,131248925,2017-02-11,12903053,Aman,This was a great place and as good as advertised. Loved my stay 
14868157,132054658,2017-02-15,23910258,Lisa,"The yellow room is a nice, sunny bedroom. Even though it's a Victorian era house, the heat works well and there's lots of hot water and good pressure in the shower. Lori is very sweet and helpful. And she makes great coffee. "
14868157,132827617,2017-02-19,114371142,琳,Lori is a really nice host!! I was really enjoy the time when I stay in her house. The room is so warm and everything is good!! 
14868157,135171237,2017-03-03,8868360,Jonathan & Silvia,"Lori's house is exactly as described in her listing. It is her home, it's not some B&B where the host comes and goes etc. the house is cozy, warm, inviting, peaceful and relaxing. You get access to all areas: kitchen and everything in it, the living room with tv, which I didn't due to my long days and my being too tired afterwards to use it. There are a ton of restaurants within walking distance or a very short drive (less than 10 minutes). It's located close to the T if you don't have a car like I did. The room was spacious and spotless. Towels were provided, there was a closet with wooden hangers for clothes hanging. I've never seen wooden hangers at an Airbnb! Usually it's those cheap plastic hangers that will break under a pair of slacks. And lastly I was there when the temperatures ranged from highs of 60 to lows of 15 and the room, and house, was always warm on the cold days and vise versa. I highly recommend it!"
14868157,135845408,2017-03-06,88341718,Katy,"Very clean, very comfy, Lori is very nice and welcoming.  "
14868157,137151423,2017-03-13,116515478,Amya,"Lori is a really sweet and accommodating host, and her home was lovely. The bed was really comfortable and the room was warm. I appreciated her clear instructions, and recommendations for restaurants and places to go."
14868157,138387252,2017-03-19,24181589,Emily,"Lori was such a sweetheart and a warm hostess. The house is very unique, in a great location, and feels very much like staying in an actual Bed and Breakfast."
14868157,139450796,2017-03-25,10413228,Abigail,"Lori, thank you so much!! Your place is beautiful, comfortable, warm, and honestly one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at. "
14868157,141521798,2017-04-03,119955296,Jens Christian,"First time airbnb. And I have to say that Lori put the bar very high for my future airbnb visits with other hosts. Her house is so beautiful and filled with personality. You can easily make yourself at home and relax after a busy day. The area around the hozse is quiet, but still the T is close and you can reach downtown in less than 45 minutes, which is absolutely ok. Lori can give you a lot af good tips for eating, visits, art and all about JP and is always there for a good talk about everything. At Lori's you get more than a bed and breakfast."
14868157,141900801,2017-04-05,71304673,Alex,"Lori's place is so charming, cozy, and makes you feel right at home! The house is so clean, as well as very organized so it's easy to navigate and feel comfortable from the start. I would absolutely recommend staying with her in JP! A lovely neighborhood and an even lovelier host! Thank you for a wonderful stay Lori! "
14868157,142492793,2017-04-08,11245402,Sophie,"Staying at Lori was wonderful, comfortable, easy-going, in an interesting and close to downtown neighborhood. Lori is very nice and we can catch a bit of what it is to be living in Jamaica Plain with her and her place. Access to kitchen, food for breakfast and cofee made my busy stay both practically easier and fun - for I could chat with her and her guests. Thanks Lori."
14868157,143618936,2017-04-12,598150,Tracy,Lori was my Airbnb angel! She rescued me from a bad situation and fed me cheese and sausage with sangria with herself and neighbor . her house is so beautiful like her heart! I recommend everyone to stay here if you are visiting the Boston area!
14868157,144410898,2017-04-15,20980309,Brenda,"I highly recommend that you stay at Lori's place--not only does she keep an immaculate and lovely home, but she's very accommodating, and knowledgeable about the city!"
14868157,145520019,2017-04-18,95455033,Alison,"I can't praise Lori's place highly enough. It was fabulous. A house full of character and a gorgeous comfy room. Lori is such a wonderful host, she even revived me with ginger ale when I returned home wrecked after the Boston marathon! The location is lovely and super easy and quick to get into town to see Boston. If you are travelling solo and want a non-intimidating place for a delicious cheap supper, check out the Mexican Chilcates just up the road. "
14868157,146153049,2017-04-21,4647197,Laura,"Lori's place is nice and clean and the bed is comfortable. Lori helped out with suggestions and tips about restaurants, places in to go, transportation, etc. Only comment is that the bedrooms are upstairs and to avoid scratching the stairs, luggage must be carried up the stairs without touching them so if you have heavy bags you will need to coordinate with her to get them carried upstairs for check/in and check/out.  That is the only special thing to mention, but Lori was able to help out so it all worked out. A good place if you want a nice, quiet place to sleep that is close to the subway. "
14868157,147038329,2017-04-24,27114816,Jitong,This place is quiet and close to subway. The host Lori is very helpful.
14868157,147936222,2017-04-29,6406277,Tom,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was fantastic. Lori's house has lots of character and you can tell she takes agreat pride in making sure her guests have the best stay possible. Transport into central Boston is extremely convenient and easy. It's in a friendly neighbourhood, Lori's shower and bathroom is immense. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality."
14868157,149719019,2017-05-05,43301837,淑君,The direction is helpful. Lori is very kind and her house (with garden) is soooo beautiful! She provided me with lots of useful information like the open hours of MFA etc. It is the perfect place! I will definitely come back if I visit Boston again.
14868157,150680038,2017-05-08,41084189,Guanglei,The place is really nice and comfortable. The location is really close to public transportation. Lori is really warm to me and amazing host.
14868157,155111037,2017-05-27,4521694,Alexandra,"Staying at Lori's place was great! Her house is adorable and perfectly set up for her Airbnb visitors. Everything was clearly laid out and check in and check out were a dream. Room was comfy, cozy, and as advertised. The neighborhood is adorable and close to some lovely coffee shops and restaurants as well as several large and beautiful parks. The location was also perfect for commuting into back bay. The orange line stop is only a few minutes away and gets you into downtown 15 minutes. Painless. 

Lori herself is wonderful and a perfect host. She was very understanding when I had to leave suddenly for a few days and we shared some good chats. Overall, I would highly recommend staying at Lori's to anyone and hope to come back in the future!"
14868157,155777168,2017-05-28,129315586,Diana,"First time using Airbnb and it was awesome. Lori is great. The house is really nice. And the room is even prettier than pictures can tell. After a long day walking around the city, sleeping in that very comfortable bed was all I needed. "
14868157,156207968,2017-05-29,58847868,Lin,"The one-night stay was a very nice experience in my trip. Lori is a sincere and considerate host.  She even walked with me to the nearby restaurant, being afraid that I could not find it easily. In fact, there are quite some restaurants just 5-minutes away from her home. I also had the luck to enjoy her artwork of photography, which is fabulous. "
14868157,157115458,2017-06-02,24413511,Andrew,Such a lovely home and Lori is a fantastic host. Highly recommended and incredible value for money 
14868157,158816995,2017-06-08,59220620,Helen,"Lori was a fantastic host- always checking everything was ok and offering recommendations for places to go. The space was beautiful and had everything that could be needed for a comfortable stay. The T station is really close by so heading to central Boston is very easy. The neighbourhood itself is lovely and quiet and a short walk away are the restaurants and shops of Jamaica Plain. I had a wonderful stay and would absolutely recommend for any stay in Boston, couldn't have been better."
14868157,159773564,2017-06-11,1601196,Samantha,"Lori and her home are the best of Airbnb: lovely, authentic, generous, thoughtful. The location is about a 7-minute walk from a T stop in a real Boston neighborhood. The house is immaculate and cozy, and filled with antique details--but the plumbing and wifi are 21st century. The garden's deck is a treasure for relaxing, and Lori herself makes everyone feel comfortable, whether offering breakfast fixings, freshly baked cupcakes, or just time to chat. A wonderful value."
14868157,160547817,2017-06-14,8519151,John,"Lori could be the best airbnb host ever.  I joined her and her friends for cocktails, she arranged special accommodations for me, and provided exceptional ease of stay.  Thanks for a great vacation. "
14868157,161337515,2017-06-17,9217777,Megan,JP is a sweet little section of Boston. Lori's house is close to the MBTA Stony Brook Orange line  station which can take you right downtown(Back Bay). I spent two nights in her home while attending a conference & will definitely find an excuse to go back. There are also many restaurants available on Centre St. right there in JP. 
14868157,164540698,2017-06-28,7962842,Jenny,"Best Airbnb I have been to in Boston. Excellent location, easy to get around via public transportation or walking, and easily parked my car on the street. The house was lovely and Lori was incredibly welcoming and friendly. When in Boston, I will always check to see if she has a room available now! Thanks, Lori! "
14868157,165389850,2017-07-01,73865016,Johnson,Excellent stay at Lori's for my first airbnb visit. Lori is abundant with hospitality and knowledge about the area. Room was very comfortable.
14868157,166531878,2017-07-03,17420324,Povilas,The room was clean and it has enough space. The location is good and quite. It is only 5 min till the train station and 15-20 min till city centre. Very good commuting. Lori is very nice and helpful. She was very flexible with my Check-in time and waited for me when I came late. Big recommendation for this place.
14868157,166833902,2017-07-04,106188768,Jonathan,"It is an old house, so if you can imagine what it would sound like stepping on the wooden floor, you would guess that the doors and floors would creak all around so you'll hear people throughout. If your'e okay with that like I was, then cool! But if your're a light sleeper, probably not. Also, please ask Lori on how to turn on the light switch in the bathroom upstairs as well:D There is lots of great information in the room as far as what Boston is like; tour guides, restaurants, clean room, awesome AC, towels, comfortable bed (not for super tall fellows) etc. The room was a convenient stay and the place is close to the Train station, convenient to get to and back from Downtown Boston. Overall, I had an okay stay."
14868157,167698176,2017-07-07,61604884,Jacob,"The room was as advertised , and was clean, bright and welcoming. The whole house had a warm charm and this was also shown through lori's honest hospitality. Really close to the T, and very easy to get downtown. 
Would stay again and highly recommend lori's place. 

It was the perfect place to rest after a long flight from hk, and helped make my stay in Boston, fantastic. 

Thanks Lori! "
14868157,168536013,2017-07-09,70167999,Carly,"Thanks to Lori, I felt well prepared for what ended up being a clean and charming bnb experience. I'd absolutely stay here again.

One helpful transit detail that I discovered: there is a bike share dock a <10 minute walk from the house! And thanks to the bike path along the Southwest Corridor, it is incredibly easy to take a straight shot bike commute right into the heart of downtown. "
14868157,170057706,2017-07-14,97847664,Martha,"Enjoyed meeting Lori very much and loved my stay at her home while attending a conference all week in the Longwood Medical area of Boston. I drove to the conference a few days (7 min drive) and also used public transportaion, which was easy, and quick, too. I love Lori's style: organic, clean, comfortable. In addition to the single rooms with shared bath, she has this cool 3rd floor suite with 2 beds, kitchenette and bathroom. I'm keeping this in mind when I take my son on college campus tours in the Boston area. I felt safe in her neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was.  
Thank you, Lori!"
14868157,171472179,2017-07-17,1772810,Xu,"Lori has a charming old house with lots of character, it's close to the orange line so easily connected to downtown Boston and Cambridge. Lori is an excellent host, friendly, easy to talk to. I had a great time staying here."

Walking distance to heaps of great restaurants and the brewery. 5 mins walk to the train . 2 stops to the Arnold Arboretum which is a must if you have the time . Lori is great with local advice on what to see and do . 
14868157,175742418,2017-07-29,16325768,Thomas,"Charming house in a lovely neighborhood. Close to public transport. Good value. The room, kitchen and bathroom are clean and communication with the host was perfect. Yes, the house is creaky and might need some paint here and there, but that's what makes it so charming. Definitely recommend."
14868157,176775398,2017-07-31,110878269,Allison,"I booked on behalf of my Mom, so in her words, ""Wonderful experience Lori is so friendly and engaging.  The room was clean and had all I needed.  Loved being in an old house."""

14868157,179829786,2017-08-08,69283810,Donna,"The yellow room was just as described in the listing -- and clean and comfortable. Breakfast was perfect and coffee superb (French press!). I enjoyed talking with Lori over breakfast. I arrived late at night and had to leave early so, I didn't get the opportunity to enjoy JP or Lori's lovely outside sitting area."
14868157,180173382,2017-08-09,5048604,J.P.,Lori's home is very charming and nice.  She was a great host and the space has lots of character.  I would certainly recommend staying here!

14868157,186844984,2017-08-25,147102524,Zul,A very welcoming and warm place. Lori was always very friendly and considerate. The location of the house was also very convenient.
14868157,187742765,2017-08-27,74156731,Erika,What a fantastic spot in JP! This charming home is minutes from the T and Sam Adams brewery. Lori is an absolutely wonderful host and will make you feel so welcome! I can't wait to come back.
14868157,189377746,2017-09-01,27858488,Rosie,"I had such a great time staying at Lori's home! The house and room are lovely, clean, comfortable and filled with charm and character. Lori is so welcoming and had lots of advice about places to visit, to eat etc whenever we saw each other. It was my first time in Boston, the neighbourhood is really nice with nearby bars and cafes and really close and easy to get into the city on the subway. Thanks again Lori, I had a great stay!"
14868157,189714710,2017-09-02,26328639,Daniel,"Lori is warm and welcoming, and is an exemplar of a wonderful Airbnb host. Her home is both beautiful and cozy. It has so much character and made for a wonderful stay in Jamaica Plain. I will definitely be recommending Lori and her home to friends!"
14868157,190971272,2017-09-05,36717885,Norma,Lori's place is very homey and comfortable. She makes you feel right at home the moment you arrive!  The place is very well equipped with all the necessities. You cannot go wrong with this beautiful place

14868157,191379067,2017-09-07,26223458,Judy,"I did not get to stay at Lori's place because of weather issues. However, Lori was exceedingly accommodating when I had to change days and generously gave me back a portion of my payment when it turned out that I couldn't come at all. 

I will definitely stay at Lori's place the next time I need to overnight in Boston."
14868157,191740000,2017-09-08,142458687,Alex,"Stay at Lori's place. It's a beautiful old house with lots of charm in a vibrant neighborhood. She is a gracious and thoughtful hostess, and keeps the place clean and provides all the accommodations you could need."
14868157,192063562,2017-09-09,5062076,Rachel,I highly recommend Lori's airbnb. It's like a real bed and breakfast. Lori is a fantastic host who went out of her way to be accommodating and make sure I had a great stay.

14868157,194818990,2017-09-17,74196894,Paula S.,"This room is about 5 min walking from T station (orange line). I found it easy to get around and a safe neighborhood to walk around at night. Lori provided me with all the details I needed before my arrival, which was great. I definitely recommend this place in JP."

14868157,197730231,2017-09-26,104031723,Dana,"Lori's home is incredibly charming, comfortable and clean -- exactly as advertised! Lori was out of town during my visit, and so we did not get to meet in person. However, Lori was easy to contact, very responsive, and the check-in/stay was seamless. It is easy to feel right at home, and Lori makes available plenty of comforts - breakfast, toiletries, etc.! 

The neighbourhood is super ""hip"" as described, and I discovered many favourites during my stay (check out the ""Papercuts"" bookstore, Ula Cafe, or take a stroll around Jamaica Pond!). It is a 5 minute walk to the ""T"", and a bit further you can find Centre Street with many shops and restaurants. 

I will definitely stay again when I next find myself in Boston -- Lori is a gracious and generous host!"
14868157,198223238,2017-09-28,145574242,Aaron,Great value. As described.

18584891,151994683,2017-05-14,35580098,Romain,"Best hosts ever ! Bill and his roommate were very nice and accommodating. They were helpful in helping us to find what we were looking for.
The Victorian house is beautiful and very typical.
I highly recommend Bill's place :)"
18584891,154457578,2017-05-24,43111967,Hannah,"Bill and Corey were incredibly kind and generous. Easy short walk to the T for getting anywhere in the city. The house is beautiful and we had plenty of privacy. Great, comfortable bed!Our stay was wonderful! "
18584891,154906745,2017-05-26,23113818,Lindsay,Bill is a very great. Clean house. Highly recommend this place. 
18584891,156127961,2017-05-29,67828692,John,"It felt like staying with a relative that you like visiting. And if you find this gem I highly recommend it.

My girlfriend and I were in town for the Boston Calling Music Festival, so one of the things we were looking for was a place close to the T-line.  This house is inside a 5 minute walk to the T. Our flight had us arrive in Boston around 9am, we asked Bill earlier in the week when we could check in and he said anytime.  As far as the accommodations, we could not have asked for more. The bed was comfortable and they showed us how to use the thermostat even though we never needed to use it.  The kitchen was stocked with food and water, with a variety of coffee/tea KCups.  The first night of the concert rained so it was nice when we used the washer and dryer the next morning.  They had wonderful food recommendations, and just made the trip that much better.

As I mentioned above if you are looking for a place in Boston, you can get around anywhere from here and will be more than satisfied with the stay."
18584891,157763724,2017-06-04,78013207,Darin,"Bill and Corey were great hosts, great neighborhood!!!!!"
18584891,159317768,2017-06-10,112450147,Taylor,"Bill and and his co-host Corey are seriously the best hosts ever. What they offer is by far more valuable than the rate they're charging you to stay in their extra room. The pictures of the place don't do the room (or the house) justice. The plants they've grown are beautiful, and the abundance of beautiful paintings throughout the home are an added plus! Our plane arrived late and we didn't get in until 11:30 pm on Monday. Corey stayed up and corresponded with us from the moment the plane touched down, to the warm greeting and late night tour of the home once we pulled up. The walk was about 3 minutes to the Subway, and there are plenty of great spots to grab a bite around the neighborhood. Throughout the stay, they offered breakfast snacks, sodas, water, and coffee (all replenished the next day!). They were very accommodating, even during the initial messaging phase. The bathroom is stocked with clean towels and washcloths that were cleaned every day and replenished for the next morning. 

Bill and Corey were also very informative about many things Boston related. Whether you're looking for things to do, or food recommendations around town, they've got you covered. Bill also used to be a tour guide, he's got quite a bit of neat facts related to Boston that we would've never known otherwise. 

TL;DR - You're missing out if you don't stay at this airbnb. Also, during your stay take time to get to know Bill and Corey."
18584891,160555258,2017-06-14,118376177,Jarpon,"The place was absolutely perfect! The house is gorgeous and had any amenity you could ask for covered. Our gracious hosts, Bill and Corey, were completely accommodating and great at communicating anything we needed to know. It's located with convenient access to the subway but also removed enough if you want some privacy. Can't say enough good things about our stay! We'll definitely be visiting again!"
18584891,160772663,2017-06-15,128993424,Sabrina,"It is a great place to stay for a view days to visit Boston downtown. 
Friendly host, great and clean home, great place!!!
All in all it is a perfect choice to visit Boston and stay in a familiar home. Bill is a very helpful host and I recommend to stay there. We enjoyed the time so much...
Thanks again. :-)"
18584891,161074724,2017-06-16,88595445,Rebekah,Bill and Corey were very friendly and made us feel at home but also gave us the perfect amount of privacy. Very cute and cozy house :) located very close to a T station! 
18584891,161356400,2017-06-17,50935930,Emilee,"Bill's home was gorgeous, comfortable, and clean. He was very accommodating and we couldn't ask for a better host. Breakfast was wonderful :) it was really nice being walking distance to the T as well. "
18584891,164770550,2017-06-29,117633198,Elaine,Best best best Airbnb!!!!! I would definitely recommend! The house is absolutely lovely and clean! Bill and Corey are both very helpful and nice! The rooms and towels are really clean! It feel like home! Would come back next time!
18584891,166179065,2017-07-02,131075886,Jeremy,"Bill was an amazing host. He made us feel very welcome and gave us tips on what to do around Boston. His house is really close to the subway (couple of blocks away) heading downtown. Bill was very generous with the food and drinks (pastries, fruits, yoghurt,  coffee, sodas) in his house which I found to be thoughtful of him. I definitely recommend his place. "
18584891,167405293,2017-07-06,105327092,Jose,"Let me just start by saying that you'll definitely feel at home here. Bill and his house mate Corey make you feel welcome as soon as you check in. They are both super friendly, attentive to your needs, and willing to give you recommendations if you plan to explore Boston. The place is clean, beautifully decorated with various paintings and indoor plants, and just two blocks away from Shawmut station on the T red line.

During our stay, we loved unwinding in the breezy sunroom and the back yard. The kitchen is fully stocked with fruit, pastries, coffee, tea, soda, etc. that they offer their guests as a courtesy. That saved us some money on breakfast a few mornings! 

Two things to keep in mind is that the room had no blinds in the upper part of the windows, which made privacy a concern. And the AC unit, though very effective, was strangely tricky to operate. 

All in all, we truly enjoyed our stay here 

"
18584891,168494932,2017-07-09,22068303,Steven,"Bill and Corey's house was perfect for our needs! They were extremely nice and welcoming, recommended some great things to do around town. Beautiful colonial house in Boston, would recommend!"

18584891,172341477,2017-07-20,111431039,Steve,"Easy 5 min walk to Sawmut T station for access to Boston. Bill and Corey go out of their way to make you feel welcome and keep your shared bathroom clean. The house is a beautiful vintage 1890 tri-level. Artistically decorated. Room is on 2nd level with other guest room and bathroom. Dorchester is an emerging neighborhood so expect it to be a mix of new, renovated and neglected  homes."
18584891,173098124,2017-07-22,22587672,Alejandra,"Bill and Cory were very accommodating throughout our stay. We arrived early and were able to drop off our luggage before heading out to site-see. Communication was excellent and the house was clean and comfortable. 
Site was a short (3 min) walk to the nearest rail/subway station and about a 10-15 minute ride into the heart of Boston."

They have created a beautiful environment in their home especially with Bill's artwork and Corey's plants. They take the extra steps to make you feel welcome. The neighborhood is safe, there is parking on the street, the room was clean, plenty big and the bed was very comfortable. I look forward to many more stays there!"
18584891,175722213,2017-07-29,142726425,Neeti,Beautiful decor and home. The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. About a 15-20 minute drive to downtown Boston.

Corey, son colocataire, est également très gentil et serviable. La maison est magnifique, située dans un quartier calme et typique, décorée avec beaucoup de goût, on s'y sent vraiment bien. Le jardin est un petit oasis de tranquillité et la chambre est vraiment incroyable!!! Le lit est très confortable, climatisation si besoin, TV si besoin, la salle de bain et la cuisine communes sont d'une propreté (et d'une beauté) irréprochable. Bref, nous ne pouvons que conseiller de s'arrêter chez Bill pour un séjour sur Boston! Le tram est à 5 minutes à pied et la station à 20 minutes du coeur de ville. Si nous repassons par Boston un jour, nous nous arrêterons à nouveau chez Bill avec grand plaisir!"
18584891,180200135,2017-08-09,25027571,Adriana,"This place was everything we needed and more. The room/bathroom is beautiful and clean. If wanted, a breakfast is available. The city is easy to reach by car or public transportation. It is only a 4 minute walk to the station. Bill and Cory made us feel very welcome (and gave us just the right amount of privacy we wanted). I would definitely stay here again."
18584891,180547169,2017-08-10,135709059,Daniel,Unfortunately we stayed there one night only. We liked it a lot. Bill is a very likable person. His house is clean an comfortable. His paintings look great 
18584891,181430341,2017-08-12,143919575,Galen,100% top of the line service. They were very helpful in everyway imaginable. The house was beautiful and conveniently located to what we were there for.  We will be staying there again. Thanks guys!!!!!
18584891,181898291,2017-08-13,81092010,Jade,"This was was on of the nicest air bnb's I had the pleasure of staying at. Bill and Corey were extremely kind and are always willing to help. It was extremely close to the train station so access to public transportation to downtown Boston is a 10-15 minute walk away. the street has plenty of parking, and the house decor is beautiful. I was only there to stay for a night, but I would definitely stay again."
18584891,183539976,2017-08-17,138627204,Jamie,"I took my son to Boston for a graduation gift to see a few Red Sox games. We LOVED this place. The check in was very easy. Bill communicated with us before, during and after our stay. The room was nice and just what we needed. The kitchen was stocked with fruit & snacks and the fridge was full of drinks. We were told to help ourselves. The Red line was just a few blocks from the house with easy access to all the Boston sites. We will definately be coming back 5 Stars!"
18584891,185485180,2017-08-21,48969637,Alan,"Bill and Corey were awesome hosts. Their home is located a few blocks off the T, which made it easy for us to get around Boston. Very clean home. Very generous when it came to offering drinks such as water, soda, coffee, as well as pastries. Bill was very helpful and was easy to communicate with me.  We were also offered access to washer/dryer, which was greatly appreciated after being on the road for a week. Would highly recommend staying here if you're not wanting to stay in the city and pay big bucks. Already looking forward to my next trip to Boston and hope to be able to stay here again."
18584891,185826653,2017-08-22,145199897,Emilia,"It was awesome!  Nice,  clear,  so comfortable room that we wanted to stay there. We could use bathroom and kitchen whenever we wanted and they prepared for us some tasty snack,  tea or coffee.  I recommend this accommodation and I hope that I will be back!"
18584891,186139513,2017-08-23,140230403,Hannah,Such a comfortable and clean home. Hosts were absolutely lovely and so accommodating. Would 100% return.
18584891,186811687,2017-08-25,100792213,Cory,"Bill and Corey are excellent host. So accommodating and offer great local suggestions for places to eat and things to see. Super close to the red line for easy access to downtown, would stay here again in a heartbeat"
18584891,187208616,2017-08-26,55680911,Mahad,This was by far one of the best Airbnb's I have ever stayed at! Bill and Corey were very accommodating and the house was beautiful! The shower was magnificent and my girlfriend loved the room! Will definitely be back again! 
18584891,189069172,2017-08-31,25959009,A Patricia,"Bill & Corey's home is quiet and comfortable.  Our room was exactly as pictured and the bathroom was spacious and clean.  The shared bath was always available for us when needed.  There were several choices for breakfast, and It was great not having to worry about parking - there were plenty of spaces on the street right in front of the house.  We had a relaxing stay."
18584891,189389049,2017-09-01,145135439,Sean,"These two are a pleasure to stay with and host a lovely space. If you're in Boston, definitely give them a look!"
18584891,189732143,2017-09-02,71869529,Sandeep,"The place is not too far from the airport. The stay was very comfortable. The check-in and check-outs were smooth. I did fumble for sometime with the master lock to get the key inside but that was because it was my first using that lock. The private room was pretty good with a cozy mattress. TV/Netflix access is complementary.
The best thing about the stay was the provisions. We were provided access to their kitchen and breakfast which made it easy for to plan. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay at Bill/Corey.
Thank you so much."
18584891,190650554,2017-09-04,1490454,Vanita,"Lovely house, beautiful decor and classy hosts. Ideal spot for a visit to Boston. We would definitely stay here again!"

Their Home is so so nicely decorated. We would definately come back!!!"
18584891,191473518,2017-09-07,142738242,Danielle,"This room is actually bigger than it looks in the pictures! Corey and Bill are SO helpful and kind. They gave me suggestions and clear directions before I got there, and even more after I arrived! Corey even came to the train station to walk me with an umbrella because it was raining. The place is really cozy with lots of art, super eclectic. Something interesting to look at everywhere you turn. Next time I'm in Boston, I'll definitely be hoping to stay here again!"
18584891,192495141,2017-09-10,2159594,Edith,This beautiful home is located very close to the red line and is easy to find. They had anticipated all their guests needs and helped out with any suggestions and guidance in being a tourist in Boston.
18584891,193195731,2017-09-12,3387635,Rebecca,"Perfect place to stay whilst in Boston. Beautiful room, lovely hosts and great spot near the metro."
18584891,194022994,2017-09-15,145582705,Susan,Bill & Corey are very attentive to their guests needs. I felt very much like I would in my own home.  They are generous and fun people.
18584891,194360589,2017-09-16,148119410,Kamila,Very nice and friendly hosts . They are always ready to help . I really felt like at home there .
18584891,194910924,2017-09-17,52168221,Aaron,"Bill & Corey were more than amazing hosts. They were so helpful with acclimating us both to their home and their beautiful city.
Their home was cozy and felt like a home away from home! We'll certainly stay again when visiting Boston in the future."
18584891,195234136,2017-09-18,25407670,Jacqueline,"Just wow! I am so sorry we only had a short evening left of our trip when we arrived at Bill and Corey's place. First, the house is conveniently located and it wasn't difficult to find street parking for our rental car. The interior is beautifully decorated and both Bill and Corey were a delight to chat with. Our bedroom was very comfortable and well appointed. The icing on the cake was the lovely treats set out for us for breakfast. Corey even went through extra effort to set them out in time for our early departure to the airport. I hope we are able to plan another trip to Boston soon so we can plan a longer stay at Bill and Corey's place!"
18584891,195507001,2017-09-19,35463158,Suleiman,"They are super nice and the best host ever. The location is very nice, just 5 minutes walk from the station. The house was so lovely and comfortable."
18584891,195757188,2017-09-20,146967318,Chie,"インテリア、あたたかさ、すべて素晴らしい部屋でした。
朝ごはんをご用意いただき、到着する間までもさまざまなボストンの楽しみ方を教えていただきました。駅からも歩いて3分ほど、ボストン中心街から少し離れていますが、電車がとても便利なのでまったく不便は感じません。

また、ボストンにきたらこちらにお伺いしたいと思います。BillとCoreyのおもてなし、本当に素晴らしかったです。"
18584891,196000433,2017-09-21,28609084,Janina,Perfect place to explore Boston. Cosy and clean townhouse with two perfect hosts. Delicious breakfast in the morning inklusive. Very good and fast connection (T-Train) to Boston city center.
18584891,196561590,2017-09-23,30854639,Sophie,"Make yourself a favor and book this room! Just a couple of minutes of walk from the metro red line will get you anywhere. Beautiful big room in a lovely house, comfy bed, nice breakfast and the most welcoming, helpful and carrying hosts!"
18584891,197725254,2017-09-26,131613335,Jennifer,"We're so thankful for the time we spent in Boston with Bill and Corey. This was an unbelievable Airbnb experience. Not only did they open their beautiful home to our family, but they made us feel like family from the first moment of arrival. 

The breakfast options are great (you have to try the scones if they have them) and there are drinks available in the fridge if you're thirsty. 

If you're looking to stay just outside of downtown, this Airbnb is right on the red line and only a few blocks from the station. A very convenient location!! We would definitely stay here again. We were traveling with an 18-month-old and they were very accommodating of our needs."
395975,17606628,2014-08-14,1941654,Ann,"Mike accepted a last minute request for a stay in a very responsive and timely manner.  Mike is very personable and his space was perfect for our needs.  We wanted a place that had easy access to the airport for a very early morning flight.  His 3rd floor apartment is clean and welcoming and the beds were comfortable.  He is knowledgeable and enthusiastic and was very helpful in answering many questions about the area! We did not have time to enjoy all the amenities close by (beach, bars and downtown), but plan to next time we are in Boston.  I would highly recommend Mike and his apartment.  "
395975,18926157,2014-09-02,20631829,Samantha,"I needed a place to stay last minute and Mike was very accommodating. I had a pleasant three night stay at this South Boston apartment. The place is a couple blocks from the beach and you have easy access to the airport. It is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I had a lovely stay at Mike's apartment. Great location, great host!"
395975,46635939,2015-09-12,25906290,John,"Mike and Tim were great hosts. Extremely friendly and knowledgable about the area. Their place is great if you want to be able to easily get around the city. 

The place was kept nice and clean and I definitely felt welcome and at home while I was there."
395975,49039175,2015-09-30,11445731,Miriam,"Die Unterkunft bei Mike war eine gute Entscheidung. Beide Jungs sind sehr nett und aufgeschlossen und wir haben uns direkt wohl gefühlt. Über das übliche Hallo hinaus haben wir uns gut unterhalten und den Abend gemeinsam mit Mike verbracht. 
Die Lage der Unterkunft ist sehr ruhig und in einem schönen Wohnviertel gelegen. Von der Dachterrasse aus kann man abends die Gebäude am Hafen und einen Teil der Skyline sehen. Mike war im Vorfeld sehr hilfsbereit und hat uns die Anreise und auch die Ankunft sehr leicht gemacht. Das Zimmer ist zwar relativ klein für 2 Personen mit 4 Gepäckstücken, aber für eine Nacht war es total ausreichend. Auch das Twinbett war für 2 Erwachsene sehr schmal, aber gemütlich. Zu Fuß kann man in kurzer Zeit das Wasser, den Strand, Pizzerien und einen Supermarkt erreichen. Die Anreise ohne eigenes Auto ist empehlenswert. Wir hatten wirklich einen sehr angenehmen Aufenthalt und würden jeder Zeit wieder bei Mike und Tim übernachten."
395975,49802585,2015-10-06,14848654,Andrew,"Mike made us feel welcome from the minute we got there. He is very knowledgeable on the city and a great host. He is laid back, always willing to help, and strives to ensure you have a great experience. We would love to stay with Mike again"
395975,51490439,2015-10-20,45548497,Ping,Mike is an excellent AirBnB host!  The check in process was seamless and very easy.  He provided several gems that only a local would know - including transportation advice that saved me a money and time!  Definitely a solid guy to stay with if you are ever in Boston!  
395975,51762345,2015-10-24,36918215,Larisa,"We spent two nights at Mike's. Absolutely positive experience. He and his housemate, Tim were really nice& open. Mike also gave us lots of useful recommendations and constantly offered to help :) truly appreciated ! 
We would recommend staying with the guys! 
"
395975,70642573,2016-04-19,17417650,Brittany,"Mike was a perfect host! After arriving very late Sunday night, Mike stayed up and even assisted when we could not find parking. Though Mike was not around much, he went above and beyond providing information on the best stops to visit in Boston, as well as the fun exciting events taking place. I would highly recommend Mike to anyone!"
395975,78023876,2016-06-05,15940651,Eugene,"Mike is a really chill guy. He was very accommodating, and knowledgeable about Boston. I had a great time, and would stay with him again."
395975,86006847,2016-07-14,29965330,Starson,"Mike is very friendly and helpful. He texted me all the information I need. The description of the room is accurate. The location is good, close to the convention center and bay. The room is nice and clean.  "
395975,87817301,2016-07-22,76311014,Elliott,"Experience was simple. Liked that the lockbox was there so I could come and go whenever I pleased, regardless of Mike being there or not. Wi-Fi was fast, bed comfortable, and location was quaint and chill. Great way to save money over Bostons outrageous prices in the summer. I'd stay here again."
395975,89438337,2016-07-28,85650339,Chris,"Great stay overnight. Easy access to get in with the lock box and Mike is super easy to get a hold of and get a response back. Room served its purpose, nice night's sleep and convenient checking out. Just far enough to escape downtown but still within walking distance! Didn't get to the beach, maybe next time! Thanks Mike."
395975,97787281,2016-08-28,25714620,Douglas,Great stay at Mike's place! It's quite close to downtown as well as the beach and Mike is a very helpful host who provide an exhaustive list over things to do while in Boston. Recommended! 
395975,103099096,2016-09-20,57450442,Michelle,"A wonderful experience my for my first (very short!) trip to Boston. Mike was a gracious host and made me feel very welcome in his home, readily available with answers to any of my questions and some great recommendations. Apartment is very spacious, and the room is as described. Loved the neighborhood...very quiet, very walkable, and I loved hearing the various sounds from the nearby waterfront. Two thumbs up! "
395975,109434180,2016-10-21,72975052,Victoria,"My stay at Mike's was great!
I had trouble with my travel and he was understanding and helped in anyway that he could & had some wonderful suggestions for a verities of places to dine at near by his place. 
Public transportation & walking around were great in the older part of south Boston where he is at. 
Also the beach & a couple of parks are a few minutes away!
Would definitely stay again!"
395975,113391645,2016-11-12,672296,Philip,"Mike was so accommodating. The whole reason I prefer staying in an Airbnb than a hotel. While the room was small, it was perfect for my needs. He was so helpful in giving me local advice to get the best out of my trip. Great guy. Strongly recommended, "
395975,137149728,2017-03-13,16419572,Sean,"Mike's place is great for a solo traveler, especially if they're looking to be near the BCEC (I was working a convention there). Easy to get in & out. Plenty of Lyft drivers nearby. 

Mike was a terrific host, providing a ton of helpful information about places around the city whenever I asked. He's also just a cool guy doing some interesting work.

Mike's building is older, so it isn't the swankiest outfit, but the price is awesome for last minute travel plans. The AirBnB room would be tight for two people, my partner and I got lucky because Mike's roommate had just moved out and left a bigger bed. That won't always be available, so this place is best for a solo traveler. "
395975,138791947,2017-03-21,628322,Scott,"If you're looking for an authentic ""Southie"" location, Mike's place is it. Nestled in the heart of South Boston, it is within walking distance, as advertised, of a whole lot of culture and outdoor activities. The room with the access to the roof is a bonus and getting to stand up there and watch the sun rise over the park was a treat."
395975,145211618,2017-04-17,121114051,Tiffany,"Mike is an amazing host -he was extremely helpful with great suggestions on places to see and things to do in Boston. His place is in a gorgeous neighbourhood by the water, not too busy either which we liked and just a 1 minute walk to the bus stop. Very down-to earth relaxed guy and we had a great stay for 5 days. We will most definitely be back!! "
395975,152256646,2017-05-15,61087651,Landan,"Mike is a fantastic host. Very communicative and has plenty of helpful suggestions for food, activities. 

The apartment was clean, the bedroom was cozy. Couldn't be happier. "
395975,170089691,2017-07-14,60638018,Matt,"Mike is a great host.  Nice guy, fun to talk to.  I was very pleased, the only downfall was very little parking."
395975,172036449,2017-07-19,53713403,Nancy,If you want to say you've been to Southie and have sense for what South Boston is - stay here.  Uber usually shows up in 2-5 minutes.  Mike and his brother are both great guys with kind and easy going natures.  They make an effort to extend hospitality to people who are guests staying in their home while at the same time doing their own thing - while you are doing yours.
1252489,5154170,2013-06-15,6792695,Emil,Samantha's apartment is a lovely place to stay in a perfect location in beacon hill .  She went above and beyond to provide a convenient and helpful check in and check out .  
1252489,5253539,2013-06-20,6389316,W. Sean,"Sam's place was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Would highly recommend it. "
1252489,5285362,2013-06-22,6792695,Emil,"This was my second stay at Samantha’s apartment and she was again a gracious host, making check-in and check-out easy and convenient.  The apartment was lovely, comfortable and located in the heart of Beacon Hill -- walking distance to many downtown locations including Mass Gen Hospital and MIT.  "
1252489,5419761,2013-06-29,6763735,Clemente,"Great location, great landlord."
1252489,6049960,2013-07-28,6958104,Ben,"Samatha's apartment was perfect. It was clean , spacious and in a great location which has many great bars, restaurants and shops nearby.

Samantha was a great host and I would recommend her place to anyone wanting to stay in Boston.
"
1252489,6292049,2013-08-06,7800678,Christina,"Very nice, very responsive. Everything clean and tidy. Had a very nice stay at the apartment."
1252489,6374887,2013-08-10,7614001,Marialanna,"An absolute gem--even better than it looks in the pictures.  Amazingly spacious for a city apartment, and the bed was  the most comfortable I've slept on in ages. No kidding. The neighborhood is beautiful too. Could have wandered around for hours, if only our stay had been longer. Sam was warm and easy going--great to connect with. Highly recommend on all counts!"
1252489,6567556,2013-08-17,7808435,Dominik,Everything's perfect!
1252489,7047681,2013-09-04,4158466,Greg,"Everything about our stay at Samantha’s place was wonderful. The pictures are a great representation of how it really looks and I would much rather stay there than any hotel nearby. It did have a/c which was nice since it was a bit warm and humid outside. It’s located in a great neighborhood on a charming street and very accessible to all Boston has to offer. She went out of her way to make sure we received the keys and had an enjoyable stay. A tip for guests who bring a car since parking is limited in Beacon Hill, there is underground parking garage walking distance at Boston Commons where we only charged $12 per day. "
1252489,7333207,2013-09-16,6281934,Ryan,"The apartment was perfect! Great location, clean and a great size. Samantha was also super helpful. I highly recommend it."
1252489,7397142,2013-09-18,6981399,Susie,"Wow, what a great place! First of all, the location is wonderful and so convenient for doing so many things in Boston. We walked to the North End in about 15 minutes, and we could hop on the Green, Red, and Blue lines within about a 10 minute walk (maybe more lines are nearby, but those are the ones we took). The area around the apartment is really cute, and it is close to many shops and coffee places, etc. 

The apartment itself is wonderful as well. Sam has it decorated very nicely, and the bed is really nice and comfy. We weren't able to meet Sam, as she was out of town, but she made it super easy to get the keys and she left clean sheets for us. She even offered us a bottle of wine, which was wonderful.

We definitely recommend it for a great place to stay in Boston!"
1252489,7718125,2013-09-30,8894994,Davis,"Could not have asked for a more conveniently placed, fully equipped, eternally comfortable, gloriously quaint, mercifully temperature-controlled, highly accessible home base for a weekend getaway to Boston. Samantha was an accommodating host and, despite her being away from the city, was accessible and helped make our stay carefree. All went off without a hitch. Highly recommend!"
1252489,8042870,2013-10-14,4224126,Emily,"Samantha's apartment is absolutely lovely. It's in a truly superb location, and the place is spotless and extremely comfortable. Sam was very accommodating and flexible, making check-in and check-out effortless. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. It's the perfect getaway for a weekend in Boston -- highly recommended!"
1252489,8236285,2013-10-21,2791078,Daphne,"Samantha's apt was exactly as described and she was a perfect host. I was flying in late from the west coast and to accommodate my schedule, sent me keys ahead of time.

I highly recommend!"
1252489,8384911,2013-10-28,1025231,Julius,"We had the pleasure staying 2 days at Sam's place. It's a lovely decorated apartment with loads of space,very clean and well situated close to the city centre. Only downside was the parking situation, it's really difficult to park nearby. Communication with Sam was easy and fun.
We would love coming back one day:)"
1252489,8538518,2013-11-04,1981948,Gina,"Samantha was a terrific host! The apartment is in a perfect location, close to the Park Street station and Boston Common and in beautiful Beacon Hill. Sam met me at her apartment in the morning to hand over her keys and gave me a quick run down, and then was on her way. I had no issues at all during my stay! The apartment is very large, very beautiful and was exceptionally clean. I will definitely stay here again, if i need to come back to Boston. 5 stars!!"
1252489,8661709,2013-11-11,9366629,Rachael,"Our stay at Samantha's apartment was awesome.  She really allowed us to make the place our own for the weekend.  She met us at her place to swap the keys and gave us free reign over everything in the apartment (even her wine collection!).  She also made herself available to us if we had any questions throughout the weekend, which was an added bonus.  The location could not have been better.  Beacon Hill is stunning and it was within walking distance to many of the city's attractions.  Definitely going to recommend Samantha to any friend's travelling to Boston!"
1252489,8865438,2013-11-22,8902027,Lisa,"The apartment was absolutely perfect! Samantha was a wonderful host, very accommodating and helpful. We were sad to have to leave - we could have stayed forever!"
1252489,10281721,2014-02-10,4611593,Stefanie,"Sam's apartment in Beacon Hill was the perfect stay for my mom and I during our girls weekend to Boston.  The apartment was immaculate, extremely cozy, and a perfect place to come back to after being out in the cold all day.  Sam was always available when I had questions about the neighborhood or the apartment itself and was easy going about check-in/check-out times.  I will definitely be back to Boston this summer and looking forward to staying at Sam's place again, if she'll have me."
1252489,10557484,2014-02-24,840018,Zachary,"Beautiful and immaculately clean, Sam's place is a gem in the heart of the city. Located on a historic street in Beacon Hill, this listing is perfect for a couple exploring Boston for awhile. The bed is extremely comfortable, and we slept great. The host Sam, though we didn't get to meet in person, was very communicative and flexible, letting us leave bags in the apartment and just generally responding almost immediately to any questions we had. The check-in and check-out process was as smooth as possible. I cant recommend Sam's place enough, the location alone makes it worth every penny. "
1252489,11545045,2014-04-07,12803607,Ally,"Samantha's house is beautiful and her neighbourhood looks like a beautiful movie set. We quickly realized how quiet her street is, which led to a restful sleep (such a comfy bed!) and a relaxing place to hang out in. Her TV was great and channels extensive. Agreeing with previous guests, the free bottle of wine was a great touch. I would definitely recommend this apartment to future guests."
1252489,12109634,2014-04-23,10770333,Nick,"We had the most amazing time staying in Sam's apartment. Without a doubt has to be the best location in Boston, central to everything and great for us tourists to see the city. Great apartment, with all the comforts required. And we couldn't have asked for more from Sam as our host. Answered any questions we had almost instantly and provided us with a list of recommendation's, that were so helpful and added to an already great experience. Absolutely recommend staying here, we loved it! Nick and Em. "
1252489,12309803,2014-04-28,6320905,Jack,Samantha's apartment was perfect for my wife and I. This was our first time in Boston and the location is perfect. Your a few blocks from essentially everything (including transit!). Samantha was an amazing host and made sure we had everything we needed. I will certainly try to stay here again if in town. 
1252489,13077327,2014-05-19,7739179,Craig,"Sam was an exceptional host! Her apartment was as described and perfect for my trip to Boston. Just blocks from Boston Common, Beacon Hill is an awesome neighborhood filled with charm and history.

My flight into Boston was delayed out of Chicago and Sam was courteous enough to wait for my late arrival and helped with transportation and directions to her apartment. Being my first time to the city I didn't really know much about Boston, Sam was very helpful in pointing out some local restaurants and pubs. Her apartment was clean, comfortable and perfect. I couldn't have asked for better accommodation.

Will I be back? Without hesitation!"
1252489,13700784,2014-06-02,3762412,Adam,"Samantha was a fantastic host and very easy to coordinate with. Even though I was a late arrival, she went out of her way to make sure the keys were available to me for a smooth entry.  She made sure everything was spotless when I arrived and even went as far as to offer up bottles of her wine collection for me to enjoy. Her apartment is very comfortable and provides far more than a hotel room would. The bed is always the most important factor and it was perfectly balanced between plush and firm for a great sleep. The living room is decked out with a big flat screen TV with every channel in creation, and the balcony is perfect for taking in the cool vibe of Beacon Hill. Ideal location for all the sights in Boston and also very convenient to Mass General. I would stay again in a heartbeat!"
1252489,13983429,2014-06-09,7227332,Atif,Sam rocks and her place rocks!
1252489,14319815,2014-06-16,26783,Michelle,"My wife and I had a great stay at Sam's apartment.  Our primary objective was to be located right in the middle of Beacon Hill - well, that goal was met!  And, we were pleasantly surprised to have a Whole Foods Market only 2 blocks away.  We loved our daily walks in Boston Commons and throughout the historic streets of Beacon Hill.  The place was VERY CONVENIENT to the T and walkable to both Boston Commons and Public Gardens - as well as an easy stroll to Back Bay.  We loved the big glass door looking toward the rear of the old buildings, and the cool little porch.  We also had a fun time using ChromeCast to watch all our own media from our personal devices.  We definitely recommend Sam's place and plan to return again for another romantic weekend in Boston."
1252489,15702144,2014-07-14,16747019,Tammy,Sam's place is absolutely adorable! She was so welcoming and left a treat for us upon arrival. It is centrally located to everything and we walked everywhere. The place is clean and cozy and I would definitely stay here again when I go back!
1252489,16118384,2014-07-22,3530350,Myles,Great place that is better than pics.  Great location.  5 min walk to Boston Common.  10 min walk to Chinatown. 15 min walk to North End and Waterfront.  Sam super responsive and great to work with and provide lots of local knowledge.   
1252489,16474312,2014-07-28,9317227,Marisa,"We loved Sam's house--it was beautiful and very conveniently located. Great back porch and very quiet street. Definitely would recommend staying there! Thanks, Sam!"
1252489,16907193,2014-08-04,2485047,Lydia,"Samantha's place was a dream in every respect. She was very responsive to my emails/texts and the key exchange was flawless. To describe the apartment as cozy is selling it short. It is cozy but not in any sort of cramped way. Both the living room and the bedroom are more spacious than most Boston hotel rooms. The coziness comes from the furnishings and the homey atmosphere. The kitchen, although small, has a brand new stainless steel fridge and Sam left us coffee and other goodies to use freely. The neighborhood is half elegant Beacon Hill and half fun-loving West End. There are lots of cool restaurants within not much more than a stone's throw and, yes, there IS a Whole Foods within a 2 minute walk. I cannot recommend Samantha's place highly enough. If you arrive by car there are several parking garages nearby, including one adjacent to Whole Foods. "
1252489,17401611,2014-08-11,2015817,Tristan,"Sam's great. Her place is ideally suited for checking out Boston and is absolutely lovely. She has stuff like good WiFI, Chromecast, wine, beer, and doesn't mind if you might need to borrow some shampoo! Would recommend the place to single travellers or couples."
1252489,17896384,2014-08-18,14397808,Nicholas,"Sam was a great host and her apartment is fantastic. It is centrally located and a short walk to Boston's wonderful restaurants, parks, and shopping areas. The apartment itself is tastefully decorated, clean, and comfortable. Sam was readily available when we had questions and accommodated us on short notice. Highly recommended!  "
1252489,18260209,2014-08-24,18260549,Mimi,"Great Boston one-bedroom in great Beacon Hill location.  Sam is so easy to communicate with, always helpful and responsive.  We loved feeling like we ""lived"" in a fantastic part of Boston for a couple of days.  Easy to get anywhere.  Very comfortable bed and delightful balcony overlooking a beautifully landscaped courtyard.  Would love to stay again."
1252489,18889346,2014-09-02,1572631,Isabelle,"Amazing location, quiet street, a hop skip and jump away from all amenities and services. First Airbnb experience, and we had a truly amazing weekend stay and would not hesitate to stay here again! A great find!"
1252489,19610965,2014-09-15,19599138,Prudence,"Samantha has a lovely apartment that fitted our needs perfectly.  It was close to all the places we wanted to go, and was a welcoming retreat when we were done with our day.  Samantha quickly responded to our text and email questions, and made excellent recommendations for restaurants to visit."
1252489,20234785,2014-09-26,1743058,Emily,"Sam was a fantastic host. She made us feel very welcome upon meeting us at the apartment and giving us a tour of the place. She was very friendly and generous. She was always available and helpful with questions particularly as we fine tuned some details prior to our arrival. The apartment itself was amazing. A real home away from home. We had just come from NYC and a tiny studio so Sam's one bedroom with a separate living space felt huge. Very comfortable bed. Beacon Hill is a very beautiful old Boston area complete with cobble stone stress and amazing buildings. Easy walking distance (a few small hills) to freedom trail areas and park and north quarter and handy 5-10 min walk to the tube/metro on red line. Thanks for sharing your home Sam, we really loved it!"
1252489,20903011,2014-10-07,17938505,Olivia,"Great location. Close to everything. Beautiful area! 

Apartment was very clean and spacious. Very nice place to call home for a few days! The bed is very comfortable! 

We loved this apartment and can't wait to stay here again!  

Samantha was a great host and made the process very easy. "
1252489,23546286,2014-12-04,17291533,Wendy,"We enjoyed our stay - wish it could've been longer. The location is perfect!  Surrounded by restaurants, shops, grocery and just a few blocks to the Blue Line subway!  We had plenty of room and the bed was very comfortable. We slept like logs. And it was nice to be able to do a quick load of laundry so that we came home with clean clothes. We would definitely stay at Samantha's place again. She was a great host!  "
1252489,28052087,2015-03-16,29069014,Cheryl,"Sam and this apartment were an absolute dream!! The apartment is PERFECTLY located, the street looks like you're walking in old england with lanterns guiding your way. Easy access to everything in Boston. The apartment itself is huge, clean and decorated cozily. We felt like we were walking into our own home. We were given everything we needed for our stay, and if you're visiting in the winter, the fireplace works! Sam herself is sweet, funny and a very gracious host. Our entire trip couldn't have gone better and we highly recommend this apartment to everyone! "
1252489,29439023,2015-04-07,7363269,Joelle,"Nous avons adoré notre séjour chez Samantha! L'appartement est super bien situé, sécuritaire et chaleureux. Samantha a su répondre à toutes nos questions et a rendu le processus très simple. 
Le quartier est tout simplement génial, près de tout, facile d'accès. Nous avons découvert de super bons restaurants et boutiques.
L'appartement était un peu poussiéreux et la cuisine pas aussi propre que ce à quoi nous nous attendions. Toutefois, c'était très confortable. 
Je recommande cet appartement et je n'hésiterais pas à le louer de nouveau."
1252489,30391432,2015-04-21,27155537,Nick & Sam,Sam was great. Super helpful and location was as described. Everything I needed was there and the apartment was around a 10 min walk from Boston Commons and located on a great street of brownstones. Sam was always just a text away and very helpful. Would recommend. 
1252489,31004158,2015-04-30,31142244,Michelle,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Sam's apartment. She was quick to respond to any questions or concerns. The location is perfect, right in the middle of Beacon Hill, easily within walking distance to Boston Common, Charles Street, and a handful of T stations (including a blue line stop a couple blocks away which connects to the airport). There's a Whole Foods down the street, which was handy. The apartment is cute, clean and cozy, and the bed is very comfortable. "
1252489,32531554,2015-05-19,30805861,Jordan,Everything was absolutely perfect! Samantha was very accommodating and the apartment exceeded every expectation.
1252489,34743815,2015-06-11,20368268,Ben,Sam was great! I had a flight canceled and she still accommodated my new arrival time. The apartment was great and in an amazing area of Boston! 
1252489,35930261,2015-06-23,7555359,Alicia,Staying at Sam's apartment in Boston has been one of our favorite AirBnB experiences to date. Sam is super friendly and accommodating. The pictures do not do her apartment justice! She has it beautifully decorated and comfortable. It is also a great location in the neighborhood of Beacon Hill. Would most definitely stay here again in the future!
1252489,39091505,2015-07-20,37990617,Andrew,Sam was awesome! Location was great and the apartment was beautiful. Sam was very accommodating with check-in/check-out times. I will definitely try to book here again the next time I come to Boston. 
1252489,44156823,2015-08-24,38968110,Aimee,"Samantha was amazing and so accommodating. Our flight landed early and there was no problem checking in at that time, the apartment was clean, comfy, adorable and in an amazing location. I want to stay at Sam's place every time my husband and I visit Boston."
1252489,45190117,2015-08-31,12962456,Nathalie,"Sam's flat is just perfect and in an amasing location on Beacon Hill. It's in the heart of the City, close to plenty of restaurants, bars, grocery, public transport. 
The flat itself is wonderfully warm and welcoming, I felt immediately at home and very confortable, which is great when travelling on your own. The flat is nicer than the pictures online.
Samantha provided me with excellent indications and directions before I got there and even with local tips on where to eat. I hope I can be back."
1252489,46195946,2015-09-08,42070044,Nakamura,Couldn't have asked for more. Agree with other reviewers that photos don't do Samantha's home justice. Hope that we get a chance to stay again in the near future. 
1252489,46974739,2015-09-14,1963208,Thomas,It was great! Thank you Samantha for letting us stay at such a great place.
1252489,48774207,2015-09-28,13566838,Liz,"A friend and I got super lucky and fell into this listing with only a few weeks until we were scheduled to be in town. Samantha was incredibly quick in providing helpful information and unbelievably accommodating in working with the unusual arrival/departure times that we were looking to have given our schedule. If ever I had a question, I received an answer within minutes.

Upon arrival, the apartment could not have been more perfect for our needs. The photos simply don't do the size/space justice, and we were both comfortable and accommodated throughout the duration of our stay. 

The location was perfect-- Beacon Hill is both picturesque and central!-- and there were plenty of convenience stores and restaurants within walking distance that left us wanting for nothing throughout the entire weekend.

If ever I'm in Boston again, I'll be sure to look up this apt again. Thanks, Samantha!"
1252489,49977471,2015-10-08,11186617,Neena,"We had a fantastic time at Sam's place. The apartment was as described, super comfy and in a perfect location. It was our first time in Boston and Sam was very thoughtful and approachable I'm helping is feel welcome-we very much felt at home at her place. 

Sam was very communicative before and during our stay; and easily contactable. We would definitely want to stay at Sam's again and she's been a fab host! Thanks Sam "
1252489,51405751,2015-10-19,20692629,John,"Wonderful space, and a conscientious and efficient host. All logistics were communicated perfectly, everything went off without a hitch. Listing description was accurate, if not understated. It's a great spot. Would certainly recommend.  Found parking nearby (2 blocks away), and recommend to any persons driving into Boston to download the Boston Parking App. It just plain works. "
1252489,52083638,2015-10-26,23484194,Karen,"The apartment is gorgeous and has everything you will need.  It's in a great part of town, very centrally located and safe.  It's perfect for one or two people.  Samantha is a wonderful host. "
1252489,54709181,2015-11-23,44462221,Anthony,"Beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood. Sam is a great host as well, very nice and accommodating. "
1252489,64914643,2016-03-09,26705818,Greg,"One of the coziest apartments and location I have experienced in Boston.  The fireplace was a perfect accent to a long day walking around. Sam felt more like a friend then a host, offering specific places to visit as well as clearing up any speculation regarding parking and potential tickets. I can't wait to visit again just so I can stay at Sams and take her up on more of her local advice. "
1252489,70619569,2016-04-19,19999057,Nicholas,"Beautiful apartment in a fantastic location, a very short walk from the Common. Communication was excellent. Overall a perfect stay. Thank you!"
1252489,73753531,2016-05-09,54235934,Erik,"Samantha was great! Definitely the best host I have ever had. She made it clear that she cared about my needs and wants. It felt like I was staying at my friends apartment. The apartment is in a great area as well. I was walking distance to Boston Common, Charles Street and the Financial District. I really walked almost everywhere, if not I took an Uber. A great experience overall! I will absolutely stay here again when I come back to Boston!"
1252489,83914774,2016-07-04,18831750,Adriane,"Due to a nefarious neighbor, we had some issues with the key upon arrival. Samantha was very responsive and apologetic and worked it out in no time. She was very flexible and easy going about arrival and departure times and the apartment is exactly as pictured. The truth is, we didn't spend much time in the apartment, as it's ideally located in one of Boston's most picturesque neighborhoods to explore on foot or to use as a home base to explore the rest of Boston. Street parking was a little tricky but we did eventually find a spot. Be sure to check on Tatte for breakfast or lunch. "
1252489,85915745,2016-07-14,34904509,Steve,"Great stay, great apartment, great location, great host. We had a couple of hiccups at the start, but S was very responsive and genuinely helpful."
1252489,86223124,2016-07-15,65108896,Chris,The host canceled this reservation 42 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1252489,86853078,2016-07-17,77022605,Lindsay,"Good communication leading up to trip. Once there, very accommodating and hospitable! And made wonderful recommendations! Would definitely stay there again "
1252489,181939574,2017-08-13,290707,Ani,"Samantha was wonderful, accommodating me and a visiting friend to the city. The apartment was so well designed, with great taste and lots of unique touches. All was clean, check in was super efficient and welcoming, and Sam was always a quick message away if you needed anything. Couldn't have picked a better weekend getaway in my own city of Boston!"
1252489,188250148,2017-08-28,29804794,Yvonne,"Samantha's apartment is a perfect location for a stay in Boston!!! Beacon Hill is so charming and my son and I literally were able to walk to everything. Samantha was wonderful in keeping close communication with us and in answering any questions. The apartment was modern, well decorated with the greatest back patio. We would definitely come back and recommend it to any one who wants to stay there.
Thanks Samantha!!!!"
14472483,99944876,2016-09-06,22999754,Kevin,Very nice roomy apartment. The staff was very responsive to all of our questions. Great experience overall.

14472483,104021052,2016-09-25,13198138,Carena,Beautiful modern loft apartment which was comfortably furnished overlooking the financial district of Boston. My favorite thing was within a 5 min walk I could be at the market or a lot of first rate restaurants.
14472483,104639333,2016-09-27,2200896,Martin,"Great location downtown, spacious apartment on 5th floor, new furniture and kitchen, very good WiFi. In the room to the street it can get louder on the weekend, but that's why you stay in the center. The apartment is equipped very basic and no information on the neighborhood or city is available, but that is what the wifi is for. Many bars, restaurants and nightlife around. We attended a convention, walking distance 15 Minutes was perfect."
14472483,105282591,2016-10-01,91099738,Romain,The host was really helpful and responded to our questions always within a day. On the day of arrival it was really easy to do the checkin and the premises was clean and tidy. The location was perfectly located. We enjoyed our stay. 
14472483,106686031,2016-10-07,77788626,Kay,"The apartment was clean and ready for moving in when we arrived. We loved the bright and airy feeling of this rental and the location was perfect for all that we wanted to do!  There are great restaurants nearby and also just a short walk away in the harbor area. It is easy to jump on the Freedom Trail to discover the city and the whale watch is close by and fantastic (on our day we saw 25-30 whales but everyday is different). Mattresses were comfortable and it was nice having two full bathrooms. We didn't cook so I'm not sure if the kitchen equipment was adequate but coffee and coffee filters were left for us which was nice as we arrived rather late. The living/kitchen area is large and is comfortable for watching late night TV, etc."
14472483,108705444,2016-10-17,30421040,Connie,This is a wonderful space in an excellent location.  Many of Boston's main attractions were within walking distance.  The communication was excellent and everything went as planned!
14472483,112031086,2016-11-03,22557135,Denis,"Sonder was a great guest: very professional, flexible arrangements, straightforward in communications. Ultimate location for a Boston stay for downtown business, dining, visit for the tourist area, Garden events, etc. All a few minutes walking distance. Public parking right next door for a fee. Great condo for a couple and two kids. Pictures well represent the condo. Modern, minimalist decor with great taste. Perfectly clean. Easy check in/check out process. Perfect hosts!"
14472483,113951537,2016-11-14,41927721,Farah,"The booking process and check-in were super easy. This is a beautiful, open apartment with pretty comfortable beds. We walked to a lot of the major attraction in Boston and never had a problem grabbing a cab when we needed one. There are several restaurants right outside or within a couple blocks but most of the coffee shops will be closed on the weekend due to the location in the Financial District. Go to the Irish bar around the corner! The apartment was clean and stocked with plates, utensils and pot and pans but bring your own spices, etc if you plan on cooking."
14472483,114448269,2016-11-18,22818910,Phoebe,"Perfect place for a business trip. Shared with a colleague, plenty of room and privacy for both of us. Great, very convenient location, lovely apartment. Would recommend and book again! "
14472483,115303816,2016-11-23,18328016,Tong,"The only thing lower the score of this apartment is that air conditioner doesn't work. It's cold in Boston at this time, the living room's temperature is always 69 F. It's freezing cold when you get up in the morning."
14472483,115700701,2016-11-26,48495175,珉,房子非常干净而且房子很大 适合家庭旅行或者几对情侣 床睡的很舒服 床垫非常软 公寓位置也很棒 离chinatown很近

My only issue leaving such a positive report is that it will be fully booked next time lol ;) thank you, you made Boston for us. "
14472483,121241775,2016-12-15,15682341,Ella,Great place! Friendly helpful  owners. I would stay there again
14472483,122463394,2016-12-23,15263633,Madelaine,"This apartment is fantastic! Great location.  Easy to get around to restaurants, markets, shops.  The place is clean and roomy.  I would definitely reserve again next time.  Oh and the Singer team is amazing!"

The concierge were available any time of day and helped us with local suggestions and bookings. Can't thank them enough. Would highly recommend."

14472483,134290549,2017-02-26,4823870,Megan,"The apartment and service from Sonder were both great. This apartment is in perfect walking distance from the Children's Museum and Aquarium, as well as the Freedom trail, great food, and several T stops. We'd absolutely stay here again."
14472483,134847473,2017-03-01,34687567,Eileen,Great location for walking to many kid-friendly Boston attractions. Apartment is spacious and well equipped. Great spot and great Sonder experience. 
14472483,137140667,2017-03-13,100542050,Kevin,"The Sonder team really helped me more than any hotel chain would have. I originally was booked with a different airbnb host for my event in Boston. To my horror I discovered the unit was not as advertised and had a few creepy critters. 

Team Sonder saved me in a bind as I had to book a new airbnb or else my vacation would be lost. Their customer service team quickly sped along my booking and processing request. They even called me to guide me through the last few steps so I could even check in early. My day went from disaster to a sigh of relief.

The unit I stayed at was very clean, spacious, had awesome appliances and even an in suite washer and dryer. Being in the financial district you will have access to tons of night life and great restaurants. The beds are super comfortable and the space itself has ample ambient light that cascades through the large windows. 

The only potential downside is the people on the street can be loud later into the night. So I would suggest either a white noise device or ear plugs if that sort of thing bothers you. 

Overall if the unit does not win you over completely upon first glance let me assure you that the customer service will keep your interest at heart. "
14472483,140528499,2017-03-30,35547203,Ellen,This is a beautiful condo in the heart of the Financial District. I can not rave enough about this property and the hosts. Everything was super easy! I will stay here again!
14472483,146979306,2017-04-24,34124276,Nicole,"The apartment was perfectly located for a short commute to Washington St. 
We had an issue with the washing machine for the duration of our stay, but the Sonder Team was very responsive in order to troubleshoot the issue. The price of the place was spiked due to the marathon - bummer, but, was a spacious place with huge king sized beds and a decent basic stocked kitchen. The Sonder Team was incredibly responsive and communicative, and it was much appreciated. "
14472483,150849267,2017-05-09,119473117,Enzhao,Position really good
14472483,156154117,2017-05-29,51555124,Olivia,Great apartment in a superb location. Communication went great. Hosts allowed us to check in early. 
14472483,165386496,2017-07-01,124619780,Shannon,Communication with the team in Boston was easy; they responded to an item we needed fixed in a bathroom quickly and came right away. We were able to check-in early and found the building close to many attractions and safe. We would recommend staying in this apartment. 
14472483,167686651,2017-07-07,10078268,Angel,"Although we had issues with the washing machine, the team was so responsive and they also provided a small refund so I feel comfortable recommending this team and would also use them again!"
14472483,170071001,2017-07-14,11535926,Alessandro,"The apartment is in a great location, but while it tries to pass for luxury, it fails at that. First of all, the washer was not working. It was getting no water (looks like a water shutoff not working) and the door got stuck with our clothes in it, a known issue with this model that took a while to resolve. Also the apartment could use a little upkeep - light fixture in the living room is missing a glass cover, and the master bathroom medicine cabinet is old and rusty. We had issues with the thermostat - it just started spewing out hot air in the middle of July. Temperature went to 86 before we decided to just remove the thermostat cover to shut the system off and open the windows to go to bed. The building itself is loud - there is a constant sound of rushing water from the exposed pipes. The decorations are very drab, it feels very cold. There were no fitted sheets and no mattress protector which meant we woke up on the mattress. Overall, it's not what I would call a luxury apartment - but the location is superb. Sonder does a good job overall but the registration process is a pain. Also, coffee provided but no creamer! To be balanced, we did not call about those issues - no time to deal with it when I was busy all day with meetings. "
14472483,172647890,2017-07-21,122099713,Alana,"The Sonders team is just that.. a team. Unlike most of the Airbnb listings, you are dealing with employees ran by the Sonders. You do not have the personal service like other rentals. We loved the unit, but mainly because of the location. The location is unbeatable. It is 5 minutes from the State Street T stop. The only thing we had a problem with is the AC broke on one of the hottest days in Boston. It was 90 degrees in our unit for over a day. The only solution the team provided was two box fans, after accusing us of being there on the wrong day anyways. After going back and forth with a new person every time, the team finally got the AC fixed and offered a refund of 15% of my stay to be miserable for over a day while on vacation. Again, the unit is wonderful. Two king beds that are very comfortable but no tvs in either bedroom and the couch in the living room is not a pull out. In conclusion, it is a great unit as long as you don't have any unforeseen circumstances."
14472483,174331872,2017-07-25,38865174,Yoav,"Great apartment, awesome location. Close to everything. Communication was very good and we got a quick reply for any question, even at night.

We also loved the design of the apartment, and the king size beds were comfortable.

We saw that other reviewers complained about the washing machine, so we'd like to comment that we used it and it worked well. No problems at all.

The coffee was also quite good.

14472483,176266902,2017-07-30,128674029,John,This is an excellent location. Check in and out was very simple and efficient. Sonder staff were available for queries regardless of time or day. Would have no hesitation in recommending to others.
14472483,178428196,2017-08-05,90774591,Brooke,Great location and place to stay.  Highly recommend.
14472483,180163690,2017-08-09,66489193,Robert,"Everything was great and the place was beautiful. Great, perfect location for us! Thank you."
14472483,182869057,2017-08-15,5079932,Stephanie,"Location was superb. We were 2 adults and a toddler and many activities were in walking distance, aquarium, children's museum, duck tours. Space was pretty big and simple yet had all basic needs like kitchen cooking supplies, plenty of towels. We had a great stay but really would have been better with a simple improvement of fitted sheets and a duvet cover (sheets kept coming off while sleeping). We were worried about washer and AC bc of reviews but everything worked just fine. Sonder team was responsive with any questions just be prepared to talk to a different person every time. Also, we stayed on a Friday night and it was very loud until late bc of happy hour work traffic. However by Saturday night and the rest of our stay it was very quiet. Very well situated and great for young families, water splash fountain near granary tavern that amused our toddler, and a playground 10min walking distance with a sandbox near the aquarium. Recommend bringing some groceries though if you can because there's only a 7-11 closeby for milk late a night and most stores in the financial district are closed on the weekends. Definitely would stay again. Was nice that the check out was easier than usual Airbnb hosts, ""hotel-esque"" as we didn't need to strip bed sheets or take out garbage. If our family comes back, we'd stay here again for sure."
14472483,191472211,2017-09-07,103140007,David,"This is a beautifully appointed apartment in the heart of the city and minutes away from parks, historic sites and the waterfront. It was a delightful stay. The apartment is light and airy and the beds comfortable. We had a couple of practical problems which were dealt with very quickly and efficiently. The only criticisms are that the kitchen is not well equipped (no colanders or serving dishes, for instance) whilst the bedlinen and the towels are very small so that the sheets do not stay in place whilst the towels are a little inadequate. These minor issues could easily be rectified. Otherwise, this place is to be thoroughly recommended."
14472483,192913576,2017-09-11,359074,Derek & Tess,"This is the last time I will book a place on Airbnb that is run by a host with multiple remote properties. 

The apartment was unclean on arrival (window sill under repair). I notified the host, who has a very responsive team, and they coordinated prompt help (which was great). We then spent our first night there and woke up feeling groggy -- upon further inspection we discovered mold on the ceiling in the room we were sleeping in. With only a short time on vacation, we opted not to report the issue immediately (we have experience with mold and know it's not a quick fix) and instead moved all of our gear out of that bedroom into the second one. Later that evening we did notify the host, who was again responsive and apologetic. We spent the night in the second bedroom and left early the next morning.

So my complaint in this case is not so much with the host as with the property. But, in my experience, the two are very related. I've stayed several times with hosts who run multiple remote properties and I've noticed a general trend -- the places look nice, but are typically short on some day-to-day amenities (like, for example, the lack of fitted sheets). Worse (for me, at least) they lack the condition and charm of a place that a real host actually lives in (or nearby) and actually cares about.

I want to support awesome, authentic people who create great guest experiences and have made Airbnb so special. I hope (whenever possible) you consider doing the same."
14472483,197062181,2017-09-24,26601170,Jill,"Great spot! Terrific location in the Financial District that worked perfectly for us and another couple. The place was just as described and all communication with the Sonder team was quick and helpful. 

I wouldn't say the apartment was luxurious, but it was clean and the beds were comfortable. Was perfect for us. Black out blinds in the bedroom would be a good addition :)"
1178106,4780766,2013-05-25,5853115,Diogo,Great location and great staff. Check in and instructions were easy. Strongly recommended.
1178106,4914557,2013-06-01,5752384,Luca,"as advertised, very good host and responsive even at short notice. Easy, and very well organized house. About 5 minutes walking to the subway. Airbed is decent but not really good and flat, and room is very small (only the bed), but good for the price. If it's really hot outside than it's a problem because it's small and doesn't have air conditioning."
1178106,4957254,2013-06-03,3815156,Jerry,Great value for money.. Neat and clean living space.. Very accessible by public transit.. Overall great experience. Thank you
1178106,5074706,2013-06-10,6778614,Lindsey,"This is definitely great for those of you visiting Boston for a short stay from foreign countries. The house was kept clean and nice. The location is a few t stops away from some great attractions, but there isn't much nearby within walking distance. The room itself might be a little cramped for a more long term stay, but in general it was a good experience. "
1178106,5477221,2013-07-01,2032369,Charles,"Well located, not to far from the subway station, and with many nearby commerces.

It should just be noted that it is in East-Boston, which is not evident from the title of the listing, but the area seemed safe, with very frequent patrols of police cars.

The only drawback - I was on my own. I never met the host once, but there is a phone number to call his friend."
1178106,6729633,2013-08-23,3210750,Ole,"Perfect hosts!
Friendly, helpful, timely.
Location is great, clean, close to the T only minutes away from city centre."
1178106,6840350,2013-08-26,8329998,Chris,"This house/room is an excellent place to stay in Boston!! It's so near to the subway station 'Airport', only about five minutes to walk. So you have a good connection to the inner city and to the Airport itself too. 
The hosts are very friendly and for sure they will help you with everything you need help or information for. They made our stay very comfortable with their easy way to go and we had so much fun!! 
Thanks a lot for this experience!!"
1178106,6962430,2013-09-01,7189005,Dirk,"I really enjoyed staying with Islam, it was absolutely fantastic.
He had everything perfectly organised with everything that i needed before i got there, it was clear he's been doing this for a while and is a great host. Islam was extremely welcoming and spent time with me straight away to give me a rundown of the city and some local places to visit.
The location in east boston is really close to the airport and public transport was very easy to get a handle of. I stayed there for four days and had a great time. I didn't spend a huge amount of time in the house as its such a fun city, but everything that i needed was there and i was really comfortable when i was at Islam's house. He was more than happy to let me use the fridge, and had a washing machine and dryer that came in handy of course - i can't say enough good things about it really.

Loved it. Thanks Islam"
1178106,7704979,2013-09-30,7514305,David,"I didn't actually meet Islam while staying at the house, but I did meet his helper who showed up and cleaned. The room was small but comfortable, and the facilities just fine. The location is within easy walking distance of the Airport T and there is a grocery store a short walk away. Everyone seemed to be friendly."
1178106,9821114,2014-01-12,10875481,My Linh,"The place is very close to the airport and easy to go to downtown as well. The house is very nice, clean and warm. There are some pretty good places to eat around the area. Izzy is a really nice and helpful host."
1178106,9922639,2014-01-19,4274489,Landon,Nice room. Great location. Accepted me on short notice. Place was easy to find. Perfect if you are going to Logan airport and have a flight in the early morning. 
1178106,12483083,2014-05-04,10892106,Hooroo,"Dangerous, shady neighborhood, did not feel safe so we didn't stay, he refused to refund, took every penny. Do not stay with a person with such low character. "
1178106,12578594,2014-05-05,14575792,Bm,"Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war wunderbar. Alles sehr sauber, Bett bequem, Küche gut benutzbar. Izzy selbst habe ich nicht kennengelernt. Bei meiner Ankunft waren zufällig andere Gäste da, die mich reingelassen haben. Also am besten im Vorab-Kontakt sicherstellen, dass die Schlüsselübergabe klappt. Der Flughafen ist wirklich nah und die Verbindung ins Zentrum sehr gut."
1178106,13508739,2014-05-29,13689592,Sunwoo,"Izzy's house is in a good location. This is the best thing about staying in his house. On the other hand, there are several things that I want to complain about staying in Izzy's house. I texted Izzy before I leave for Boston and I called him twice when I arrived in Boston, but he didn't answer! I found Izzy's house and finally got into his house after 4pm, there was no one there. There are four rooms and only one was empty. The room was not cleaned up and it made me feel bad. That day, I met Najad in the evening. He said he is Izzy's assistant! And he told me about the room and promised me clean it up next day. Najad was helpful and nice. I understand Izzy hired assistant maybe because he is too busy or something. But I think Izzy should have written about his assistant and leave the assistant's phone number or something in airbnb! "
1178106,14243778,2014-06-15,14400147,Alejandro,"The hosts were VERY good, welcoming, open and easy going. They are always trying to help and to keep your experience good. Izzy is easy to reach and will always (in my experience) respond to whatever you need and is achievable by him. Nahshon is superb also!

My expectations were covered in terms of the place itself. It has some nice common areas (TV, kitchen and the small patio/solarium). It was a good place to be, clean because everybody (guests and hosts) collaborate to keep it that way.

The only comment I have to say is the neighborhood. It's a latin quarter, so it has a certain feeling. The first day I felt a bit unsafe by walking towards the house at 1 in the morning, but as I spent days (was there for 12 days) I realized that it is actually a safe neighborhood. It tends to be more crowded from early morning until perhaps 11 pm, afterwards, streets are lonelier, but after that first walk I felt way more safe.

vecindario"
1178106,14585817,2014-06-22,16866597,Jaeyoon,"The place was exactly as listed, clean, cheap, close to airport.  Easy to find from airport according to the directions provided by Izzy. Less than half an hour from airport. Less than half the price of the cheapest motel in the area and much closer to airport as well.  Would stay again given the chance. "
1178106,14803047,2014-06-26,16528897,Karsten,"Very warm welcome and helpful. The place was shared with more people which I like a lot. 
Very nice and clean place in a friendly neighbourhood (not posh not poor). Close to the city, subway and the beaches of Boston. YMCA is just a couple footsteps away."
1178106,14940000,2014-06-29,17195161,Lyn,"Very friendly and welcoming.  
When I wanted to drop my bags off before the allotted time it was no problem.
Also,  there was a problem with the wi fi but it was looked at and attempted to rectify before I left.
Would definitely stay there again.
No problem with the neighbourhood and directions to and from the airport was very accurate.
Thank you

1178106,15289415,2014-07-06,16207837,Joshua,Excellent host. The house and room are exactly as described. No hassles getting in or out. I had a great time. Thanks Izzy!
1178106,16217582,2014-07-23,8859767,Matthew,The room was as advertised. I didn't meet Izzy during my stay but his roommate was helpful and friendly. I neighborhood was ok and the house is close to transportation into central Boston. It took less then 30 minutes from leaving the house to arrive at state street in downtown Boston.

1178106,17112884,2014-08-07,18038439,Dominik,"I didn't got any reply to my confirmation message but everything worked fine. Location is great coming from the airport. It was sufficiently clean, but everything is really basic. That was not a problem for me - maybe it's just a bit overpriced. Wireless was working but a bit slow. People not used to US-doors should know that the first door can be opened without  any key."
1178106,17423299,2014-08-11,19699211,Jimmy,"Room and house were exactly as described. Simple, clean, convenient and comfortable. I didn't meet Izzy in person, but I did manage to meet catch his roommate for a couple of minutes. He was extremely welcoming and very friendly.

Overall, I don't have anything bad to say about Izzy's place and listing. Main reason I chose it is its proximity to the airport. I would definitely stay here again!"
1178106,17594616,2014-08-14,10114866,Ariel,"Everything was as expected! The key for the door was a little tricky, so plan time to figure that out. The room had it's own air conditioner, which was great in the heat. Thanks!"
1178106,17658288,2014-08-15,968805,Lennay,"Had a great experience here - never got to meet Izzy, but the self-check in (and out) was fast and easy. Much easier than even checking into a hotel, actually. The room is true to what you see in the pictures. Both bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Great location close to the free airport shuttle bus. Thanks!"

The location is great. A few blocks away from the Airport T Station (Easy coming from the airport and easy access to the city).
There are shops (market, Bakery ...) in the neighborhood.
The house is amazing. The AC and Wifi worked well. The bathroom was clean. Generally, the house was clean. 
The host is very hospitable. They are very friendly and caring.
I stayed there for 12 days and I enjoyed the experience very much. I would recommend this house should you come to Boston."
1178106,19224944,2014-09-08,8659611,Vivianne,Easy to find from well described direction from airport. Everything clean and as described in listing. Would recommend to those in need of somewhere safe and sound on a tight budget.

His brother was very welcoming and helpful. He even rode his bike with us and showed us some cool parts of town, and helped us navigate getting to downtown Boston. Highly recommend."

1178106,19391039,2014-09-11,11346540,Hannah,"The location was amazing!  A few minute walk from Airport station and very easy to find.  The room was simple and clean: basic, but just enough.  The kitchen was perfect to store the occasional snack or leftovers in.  The place had a grown up hostel feel to it, with several other guests staying there.  It was rather fun.  Izzy answered all of my questions promptly via text and his brother was also a great host.  I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Boston.  "
1178106,19615922,2014-09-15,9772832,Kris,"As soon as I arrived at Izzy's he made me very welcome and showed me to my room. The room was small but had a double bed and small desk. The room was very clean and tidy, the bedsheets and towels were also clean. 
The house is exactly as advertised and is very close to the train to Boston and airport. For the price and location, you can't beat it. I would stay here again when I am next in Boston. "

La cuisine est équipée avec lave vaisselle, micro onde, cafetière et autre!! Vraiment très bien!
La chambre dispose d'un lit confortable, de rangements et d'un sèche cheveux (pour celles qui ne pourraient s'en passer!).
Pourtant elle est quand même plutôt petite et il est impossible d'ouvrir la fenêtre (climatisation oblige).
Nous passerons tout de même 5  nuits agréables dans un quartier assez calme."
1178106,20150630,2014-09-24,100512,Sesalee,Nice stay and the room was clean.  Easiest Check in with Keys and Check out system . 4 rooms rented  with 1 + guest > at least on my stay  and only 1 bath room available. I didn't expect to share the only bathroom with so many people. House mates where nice to let you get in before showers. Always seemed rushed and someone was waiting on the bathroom when I got out.  Easy to get to Subway and airport. Would stay again for a short stay.
1178106,20220351,2014-09-25,3149897,Matthew,"The place was not hard to find after leaving the Boston airport.   It was clean and tidy inside.   The wifi was fast and bed was comfortable.  My only gripe is that there was only one bathroom and with several guests staying at one time you may have to wait for your chance. 

Would stay again when visiting Boston!"
1178106,20269295,2014-09-26,612745,Dustin,Izzy is a friendly happy guy and his house is also convenient to stay at 
1178106,20522248,2014-09-30,4782290,Srini,"I am glad to have found this place and stayed there the night before the travel. It was cost-effective and convenient as advertised. It was also clean and adequate. Leaving two bottles of water in the room was a nice touch.
I wish though that I had known how difficult it might be to find street side parking. "
1178106,20590920,2014-10-01,21854266,Push,"As listed. The apartment is much cleaner and nicely done compared to an average Boston apt. Comfortable stay, very convenient location. Will recommend. "
1178106,20668548,2014-10-03,21645728,Erin,"This room was quite disappointing. The instructions on how to find the room were extremely unclear, the cleanliness was severely lacking, and the other tenants were loud, making an early bedtime impossible. I was very disappointed with my stay and would not recommend it."
1178106,20707250,2014-10-04,18096852,Jennifer,"Izzy was very welcoming and accommodating of my schedule, responded promptly to any questions I had. 

Room was clean, place is an easy walk from the T. Would recommend staying here. "
1178106,20911962,2014-10-07,20985591,Joseph,"Lizzy is a really nice host, I had a great time in Boston without breaking the bank. The room is clean, internet is ridiculously fast  and I feel safe walking around the neighbourhood at 1 in the morning. Best of all, it's only a short walk to the airport T station.

1178106,20980656,2014-10-08,2937858,Rob,"I needed a last-minute place to crash and Izzy's place was perfect. He's a great host and this is a clean place with a nice setup. It's also down the street from a fantastic Italian place called ""Rino's."" Recommended."
1178106,21016213,2014-10-09,18432250,Gabriel,Room was nice and cozy! Location is in East Boston 6 minutes from airport shuttle and blue line subway. Good food in the area.
1178106,21178896,2014-10-12,6185279,Glenn,"Izzy was a great host! He helped me get settled into my room and gave me a number of dinner and night light recommendations in the immediate area. The room is very clean and cozy; just what I needed before getting on a flight back home. He even offered me dinner that he and his friends were cooking (Peruvian) and instead of going out, had a great time hanging and getting to know them. All in all, a great time!"
1178106,21386104,2014-10-16,21212767,Kelly,"Staying at Izzy's was exactly the kind of experience that my boyfriend and I needed while staying in Boston.  As travelers on a budget, we couldn't expect anything more.  The towels and sheets were clean along with the bathroom.  There is only one bathroom, so be prepared to take turns with other guests getting ready in the morning and evenings.  We ate out the majority if not all of our meals which meant that the kitchen area wasn't a big deal for us.  It seemed like it may have been difficult for the host to keep the kitchen spotless with full time renters and so many Air Bnb guests.  You can easily see that Izzy's is an overall good place to stay by the good reviews and frequency of guest staying in the home.  The neighborhood was also a good location as it was just five blocks from the airport T station.  THIS made the stay completely worth it as you can hop on the train and be to downtown or the airport in a breeze. Definitely check out the restaurants that the host recommends as he knows what he is talking about.  Delicious food right in the neighborhood! Overall...perfectly decent spot for travelers on a budget. "
1178106,22244456,2014-11-02,866643,Joshua,"I stayed here for two weeks waiting on an apartment to open up. You gets lots of living space in the house, although the room itself barely holds a bed and a suitcase. The other rooms looked quite spacious, albeit more expensive. The facilities were generally clean and tidy, although the dishes piled up quite a bit. Like another reviewer said, it feels like an adult hostel -- there are 4 other rooms that can be rented concurrently with your own. One bathroom for that many folks can get a bit competitive. Overall, I would stay here again, but in a larger room."
1178106,22347843,2014-11-03,5632042,Usman,My experience was fine. I got what I expected and there were no problems with my stay.

Me recibieron mucho mejor de lo que me esperaba! Es la primera vez que me alojo a través de Airbnb y lo volvería a hacer... aunque no creo que otros anfitriones sean tan buenos como ellos! Tuve una maravillosa experiencia! Ojalá vuelva a Boston y me vuelvo a quedar en su casa! Muchas gracias! Un beso grande y muchos cariños a los 2!"

1178106,23028829,2014-11-20,4448873,Yoshiko,"Great stay. My flight was cancelled and I needed a place to stay on short notice. He got back to me in less than 30 mins and had a welcome sign on my door when I arrived an hour later. The place was easy to find. The bed was comfortable, Izzy's brother welcomed me and was very accommodating. Would stay again."
1178106,23057354,2014-11-21,23630111,Emily,"The room was exactly as described. The individual space is small, but there was enough room for me and my luggage. The bathroom is shared, but I never had to wait. The host was there when I arrived to help me get in and carried my suitcase up to the room. I was in and out pretty quickly but felt welcome and appreciated a warm bed for the night. "
1178106,23182094,2014-11-24,22384623,Guangyu,"I didn't meet Izzy, but his brother is so nice! We talked about our experience in university and watched a football game together with another airbnber. He also recommended me some restaurants in the neighborhood. 
The room is nice, a little bit small but worth the price. I could find almost everything I need. The location of the house is also good, close to the train station and just a few minutes walk."
1178106,23483731,2014-12-01,7956275,Angela,Great location! So close to airport and very comfortable.
1178106,23541933,2014-12-03,24350972,Kaley,"This was my first experience with AirBnB and I enjoyed. The room was comfortable, in a great location after arriving at the airport, and the young woman volunteering with checking in travelers was very kind and helpful. I would recommend a stay here."
1178106,23561815,2014-12-04,9522096,Eva,"I had an excellent stay at Izzy's place! I didn't get to meet Izzy, but his helper Rose was there and she was very nice. The place is quiet, clean, and comfy. It's an easy metro ride to many points of interest. I highly recommend staying here to anyone on a budget!"
1178106,23803694,2014-12-10,510045,Mark,"My third time staying with Izzy - comfy bed, very clean place and great host. I'm sure it won't be my last."
1178106,23829634,2014-12-11,23587329,Anh,"Excellent place to stay if you're looking for something economical and close to the airport. 

Izzy was very diligent in preparing you for the stay. Would definitely recommend. "
1178106,23972961,2014-12-15,24498829,Samuel,"Everything was very clean since the beginning, my room, common areas etc. Even though I did not use the kitchen other bnbers also kept it very clean. Clean sheet, clean room it had my name posted so it mas super easy to find it & also great location from the airport literally, being my first outing in my life it was a good one. Neighborhood is ok, rather quite and makes it easy and easy to reach."
1178106,24051577,2014-12-18,21054529,Verena,"Izzy's place is perfect for a stay in Boston! It's very close to the airport (free shuttle to the next subway station and then by feet about 8mins) and also very close downtown (just take the subway and you are already downtown after 2 stops)!! My room and the whole apartment are very clean and the neighbourhood is not the best one, but ok.
I would defintily stay there again!"
1178106,24383146,2014-12-27,24551392,Jin,The room was exactly as described in a quiet neighborhood. Only 7 minute walk from the airport station! 
1178106,24445498,2014-12-28,24612124,혜연,"공항과는 확실히 가깝고 가는길도 단순합니다. 단 새벽 4시~6시 밤 11시이후 공항에 가야는 분은 공항셔틀을 타러가기위해 걸어가는 시간이 10분정도 늘어납니다 공항 셔틀을 타러가는 직선 거리상에 있는 꽤 큰공원을 돌아가야하기때문입니다. 호스트는 좀 무책임합니다. 숙소에 없기때문에 에어비앤비에서 채팅할때는 집에 좀 빨리도착할것같아 이야기했는데 호스트가없어서 다른 자고있는게스트가 문두드리는 소리에 깨서 열어줬습니다 전화통화 잘안됩니다 전 30분 기다렸는데 먼저있던 게스트는 그전날 1시간 기다렸다고 합니다 전화안되고 문에 비밀번호를 잘못가르쳐 주었다고 했습니다 집에 게스트가없었으면 추운겨울날 내내 기다려야했겠죠
시설은 그냥 사진그대로고 나쁘지않습니다 매일 11시이후에 청소부가와서 관리하는것같습이다 지하1층에 세탁기와 건조기를 무료로 이용할수있어서 좋습니다 부엌을 사용가능하지만 실질적으로 음식은 하나도 없어서 먹을것이나 식재료를 사와야합니다
위치와 그냥 하룻밤묵기좋지만 체크인 부분이 좀더 개선되면 훨씬편리할것같습니다."
1178106,25066257,2015-01-05,25355112,Tao,"I lived in the Room A on the second floor. The room was very clean, bed was comfortable with washed sheets and pillows. The bathroom was very decently clean and wide. Definitely would come back!"
1178106,25211411,2015-01-09,2023933,Carlos,"I stayed there 3 nights the place was very crowded so using the only bathroom was very difficult. Although the bathroom and kitchen was a clean one (the rest of the house was not as clean).
The room is actually an older more beat-up version of the one you see in the picture. To be honest I have stayed in worse places but I was expecting something better for the price. I think it should be 20 dollars cheaper."
1178106,25610077,2015-01-20,22511530,Grace,The home was comfortable and clean. I like that it had some available bathroom amenities in case you forgot them. Instructions were easy to follow. Izzy allowed me to drop off my luggage before check-in. The house is only a couple blocks from the subway and the Airport. Very convenient. I would stay again. Thank you Izzy!
1178106,25782358,2015-01-25,1216762,Alma,"Izzy was very helpful in giving information/direction. Although there was one part of the instruction which was inaccurate in keying the code for the entrance door, the overall experience was wonderful. The place was clean and convenient to public transportations. I recommend Izzy's place."
1178106,26330805,2015-02-09,25208366,二十,"great great stay in Lzzy's place! really sweet experience! i saw the bath mat has been changed in the morning every other day, everything in Lzzy's place is very clean. the location is quite well and this area is very safe even for one girl who travel alone. i feel as comfortable as staying at home. i will definately choose here next time!"
1178106,26401442,2015-02-11,25208366,二十,what a sweet stay! really like Lzzy' place!
1178106,26430911,2015-02-12,25208366,二十,"great location, safe area, clean place, sweet host! really enjoy my stay here!"
1178106,27178277,2015-02-27,27562442,Natalie,I loved the cute slippers and the complimentary fruit and beverages.
1178106,27453216,2015-03-04,6991643,Talia,This spot is super accessible! The host is super chill and very accomadting :)  I got in super late and they just happebed to have food made and shared some with me! I'd def recommend this spot to anyone traveling in Boston
1178106,27521174,2015-03-06,23748354,Ronjon,"Second time staying with Izzy, the guy is awesome.  Again I came super late (my flight landed just after midnight), Izzy stayed up to make sure I got in, he completely didn't have to do that.  Most importantly though he's just... nice, you know?  I really like him and am glad we had a chance to meet through airbnb."
1178106,27555262,2015-03-07,11676953,Takuma,"Very convenient place near to the airport, and the room was clean, you can get free water and breakfast, and the host and his gf were so friendly. I recommend this place."
1178106,27730090,2015-03-10,27760290,Andy,"Hi~I am Andy and I lived in Izzy's place for two nights that was awesome! Room not very big but warm and clean.really convenient to go any where from Izzy's place,any way I hope to stay again!"
1178106,27865586,2015-03-13,24318052,Jeff,Great! Izzy responded quickly to my last minute request and provided exactly what I needed! I needed an inexpensive place to crash between flights at Logan airport. His place gave me a clean room that was basically within walking distance of the airport. Check in and check out was smooth and simple. 
1178106,27906699,2015-03-14,29066194,Jack,The neighborhood is sketchy and their was nobody at the home to welcome me. The room was shockingly small and not very clean. The bed was in horrible condition and was topped with a musty comforter. There was a towel with a huge bleach stain on the bed. I opened the window to let some air in the room and after ten minutes decided to leave. I booked another room in a different area and was much happier.
1178106,28372601,2015-03-22,13751342,Erika,"I never meet izzy in person but the place was very nice and so were the tenets.  As a person from Boston, I can assure you this neighborhood is very safe and a great location to get anywhere on public transit."
1178106,28443376,2015-03-23,20612274,Douglas,"I got in a little late and couldn't see the color of the house very well; but, the directions were so good I got in just fine. The place was kept clean downstairs but was minimalist and devoid of a cozy home feel. Also, going upstairs to my room it became apparent that this was more like a boarding house with several others staying at the apartment in other rooms. That threw me off a little bit because even if the host was well rated and he screened for guests it still made me feel uneasy to have these strangers in close quarters. The room was small but functional. The bed was terrible and needs to be replaced. Quite lumpy. The neighborhood was nice. There were great pupuserias to eat at nearby and Sacred Heart parish was a short walk away which made going to mass easy. Overall it was good and I would probably stay here again. "
1178106,28500416,2015-03-24,22249619,Emily,"The room was small, but perfect for a overnight stop! The house is SO close to the airport, it is extremely convenient! The bed was comfy and clean.   "
1178106,28549307,2015-03-25,24262271,Denis,"Neighborhood is not great, but it's safe, and the house is clean and nicely decorated inside. Despite the super-low price which led to me there'd be just a bed and nothing else, the place actually had all the little perks -- a bottle of water by the bed, toiletries in the bathroom, tea and coffee in the kitchen, etc. GREAT value for money!
The host was easy to contact and answered my questions quickly.
Two pieces of info that would have made the stay smoother: instructions for using the keypad on the door (you have to press a 'hidden' button) and the wifi password. "
1178106,29080871,2015-04-03,14001967,Serene,"Izzy is very efficient in his replies and he gives very long and clear instructions so if you follow them, you will have no problem with the check in. It feels like a diy process with other airbnbers in the house. The room is very small and hardly any place to open my luggage. The bedsheets smell good however the towel was dirty with lots of hair! There was also a broken light that needs to be cleared. Communicated with lzzy and he asked me to help myself to a new towel in the basement. The toilet and kitchen is fully equiped, however you are not sure if you can use anything because there are other airbnbers around and not sure if it belongs to them! The location is not as close to the airport as i thought! If you have luggages, you dont want to drag them for ten mins walk from the T station. And with a cab ride, its almost $25 away. The neighbourhood doesnt feel as good too, but still you can find many food places walking around. If you like some privacy or diy process, it can be a good choice."
1178106,29575901,2015-04-09,931327,Jaka,"The room was great! Literally a 10 minute WALK from the airport subway station. And it took me less than 20 minutes to get downtown from the front door.

The neighbourhood was great as well, very residential so not somewhere you'd hang out and do stuff, but it's quiet at night and feels pretty safe. There are also two corner stores nearby.

My only issue was that the room was smaller than it looks in the pictures and the stairway to get there was pretty narrow. But this is only a problem because I have a giant suitcase."
1178106,29708436,2015-04-11,23748354,Ronjon,"The place is great, and Izzy's a wonderful person!  Thanks again for letting me stay."
1178106,29957204,2015-04-14,30932337,Isaac,"Cheap, Easy and Convenient. "
1178106,30056324,2015-04-16,30351692,Jeremy,"Booking went well. Izzy was very efficient and responsive. He answer questions quickly and the instructions he sent were easy to follow. 

The house was as pictured - it is a small room with good internet and a nice large living room and kitchen downstairs. My name was listed on the bedroom door and it was very easy to find. I would stay again for the price if I am every back in the area. "
1178106,30097688,2015-04-17,30438312,Mark,It had a comfortable bed and was close to the airport: exactly what I needed.  
1178106,30172086,2015-04-18,23122561,Roger,"I would not describe this place as cozy. Far from it. There was a weird odour permeating throughout the house that was unbearable. I also thought it was a dirty. In terms of the room itself, the mattress was terrible to sleep on. All the finishings in the house were incredibly cheap. I got the impression during my entire stay that Izzy placed little effort into making guests feel welcome. All in all, not a good experience. I encourage guests to find a better Airbnb host in Boston. "
1178106,30566863,2015-04-24,12452479,Sonja,"The place was not what I expected in cleanliness but the room itself was clean. The directions are written in a more complex way than they have to be. It wasn't clear to me, before arrival, that the house has several rooms, fyi. Everyone there seemed nice. I didn't get to meet Izzy, he wasn't around. Place is close to the train. Great if you want/need to be close to the airport."
1178106,31369442,2015-05-04,31487214,Richard Aka Dick,Izzy is a good distant communicator in a time sense - very quick to reply but he made no physical presence over the 3 day period of my stay and my experience was similar to being accommodated in a hostel. The room was smaller that the description given and the facilities - bathroom and toilet in the same room downstairs was shared with 6 other people.  In communicating my unhappiness to Izzy over the size of the 'cosy' room he used the word 'transparent' as his objective in describing his offering. I found this very ironic given the lack of description of the actual situation Izzy operates which is very removed from what I understand 'hosting' to mean. The kitchen and tiny room was clean and tidy and the building itself is in a central location with a shabby facade. 
1178106,32035453,2015-05-12,32304618,Omkar,Izzy was a great host. Was there only for a night this time. The room was small but comfortable. Very close to the airport.
1178106,32076843,2015-05-13,31645882,Lewis,"everything was perfect , i was feeling like home , really nice place with a really kind and welcoming person (izzy), thank you for everything .

(go to ""la chiva "" the place to eat not far from there )"
1178106,32215449,2015-05-15,22041410,TC Atll,"The location is low profile and dirty. The house is also not a great place to stay, except the price. The room was so small i could hardly move. To use the shared bathroom was not convenient at all. The noise which continued all night long made me up at 3:30 am. I am not satisfied with my stay at all. Sorry."
1178106,32667646,2015-05-19,26084918,Kurtis,"We didn't get a chance to meet Izzy but that may have been because we arrived into Boston a day earlier than planned and our check-in was relatively ""last minute"". With that said, the self-check in was a pretty simple process.

Positives: Short walk to train station, clean room, simple/unassisted check-in available, coffee/tea stand available, free street parking, and a very good deal for the Boston area

Negatives: The room was much smaller than the pictures depicted, but we didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room. We also didn't find any towels available, so be sure to bring them.

I think it is also important to note that if you aren't familiar with ""city"" living and an urban atmosphere, you may be *slightly* afraid of the area at first appearance. It is a diverse neighborhood with a good bit of foot traffic during the day with locals ""hanging out"" in front of their homes, etc. It didn't bother me personally and we didn't have any bad experience, but I could see how certain people would be a little hesitant; especially when you combine this with the ""hostel"" feeling and absence of Izzy on the premises. Parking gets tight after 6-7pm.

Overall, we would stay again if we were traveling on a budget and in need of somewhere simple to stay quickly."
1178106,33535503,2015-05-29,6758049,Justin,"Very friendly hosts, comfortable bed, AC, privacy and everything you want in a host stay!"
1178106,34260547,2015-06-06,13872389,Zintis,"Very conveniently located from the airport, and relatively easily accessible for a late-night check-in. Good value for the price; I'd stay again or recommend to others who were passing through Boston and just need a cheap place to sleep for a night."
1178106,34695734,2015-06-11,28940550,Oben,"Izzy is a great person, he is generous, kind, helpful. This place is more comfortable than your own home. He is trying to do his best to make you comfortable. He behaves like a friend. He is so kind that he took me to airport with his own car when i was leaving. The house is nice. the location is great which has beautiful Italian houses. The house is 5min away from Subway. he location is safe. I would definitely stay in the same place if i visit Boston again."
1178106,34834730,2015-06-12,35082705,Mel,"Izzy is an amazing host. He offers very agreeable lodgings, conveniently situated in Eastie close to the airport for travelers, and easy knowledge of the neighborhood. He is also a fantastic guy to spend some time in conversation with, as he's had a wide range of experiences and is enlivened by new ideas.
The house was pleasantly communal and comfortable, while my room was private and simply yet adequately furnished. It was nice and clean, and a great place to decompress and rest before an early morning flight."
1178106,34912599,2015-06-13,35225137,Pedro,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was an excellent one. Izzy was very friendly and helpful. I arrived after noon and my room was ready to be occupied, which was a great relief after such a long flight from Houston. Izzy recommended excellent places to grab lunch. The neighborhood is a bit colorful, but nothing to be worried about. The room was exactly as described, small but comfortable. The house was in very good shape, clean and tidy. Shared bathroom also spotless. As a plus, it was relatively easy to get to the apartment from the airport, since the shuttle drops you at the T station. Overall a very good experience!"
1178106,35244649,2015-06-16,34298787,Yan,"Initially I booked the room for a 3 days' travel, but something came up I had to reduce the stay to 1 night. 3 days before the arrival date, I asked the owner if the stay period can be changed from 3 nights to 1 night. Airbnb showed there should no problem, but I didn't hear anything from the owner. 
Eventually I was charged 3 nights for my 1 night stay. The house rule said cancellation can be made one week before arrival, which is unreasonable, since most hotels have 24 hours full refund cancellation policy. Also I didn't totally cancel the stay, just wanted to adjust the duration of stay. I don't think the owner is sharing the spare space with good faith, because charging someone 3 nights for 1 night stay sounds like a robbery to me. The owner was obsessed with money. If you want to book this place, make sure your plan is never going to change in one week prior, otherwise book a hotel!"
1178106,36040535,2015-06-24,12320244,H,"Izzy was a great host and the room was immaculate, temperature controlled in the room, the bed perfect in terms of comfort. Much to my very great delight the bedding, towels and room had no added perfume or scent. How amazing!!  I could not have had a better experience. "
1178106,36124509,2015-06-25,35115244,Kenta,"Clean and silent room near the Logan airport, Boston.
The host, lzzy, was really responsive and I could find the location of this room very quickly."
1178106,36481107,2015-06-28,5138971,Jyl,"The lusting description was accurate, the host was very welcoming and clear with directions. Convenient to the T. I would stay again."
1178106,36747536,2015-06-30,36811898,Yihan,The room is good.Izzy has made a good living model for his guests(there are tips to remind or help)
1178106,36815691,2015-07-01,86595,Adele,"Izzy was quick to respond to my request and sent me detailed information about the airbnb. I did not meet Izzy in person, but there was an assistant available to answer any questions I had. The room was cozy and clean like the rest of the house. 

I was on a layover and the location was perfect. Easy access to the city and easy access to the airport. I arrived pretty late in the evening so I would recommend if you're not familiar with the area to take a cab (13$US) if it's dark. During the day, it was a quick jaunt to the airport shuttle.

"
1178106,37092520,2015-07-04,31994968,Dan,"I enjoyed my stay in room A! Small, but comfortable.  I didn't have much luggage, so the room was just right."
1178106,37400670,2015-07-06,17328380,Molly,"If you're looking for a place near Logan, I definitely recommend this spot. Everything was clean, organized, and comfortable. There is a great Mexican restaurant down the street, too!

Although Izzy was not there when I arrived, his directions were very clear, and my room had a nice welcome sign. "
1178106,37694665,2015-07-09,24261903,Mateusz,I can sincerely recommend this place. It is easily noticeable that Izzy put much effort and professionalism to make airbnb guests comfortable. Location is very close to Logan airport. The house is quiet and offers all facilities mentioned in the description. You won't be disappointed on any level.
1178106,38794537,2015-07-18,29394956,Chris,The host was not present. It was self check in and the host gave instructions on the Airbnb website. 
1178106,38925885,2015-07-19,4982994,Colin,Great place. Exactly as described. Very easy to check-in and very close to the airport. Perfect place for a landing pad in Boston.
1178106,39104710,2015-07-20,10280433,Jeremy,"Nice location close to a metro station
The appartment was clean.

1178106,40382370,2015-07-30,38959658,Marianne,"Everything was perfect, as we expected the place to be. Nice people, nice place. Thanks!"
1178106,40801443,2015-08-02,30313149,Ryan,Very casual environment at Izzy's place.  It's nice that it's just a walk from the airport and also very easy to get to downtown.  
1178106,41182268,2015-08-04,24774959,Ronald,It was as advertised. Some noise from other guests kept me up but overall good experience. Izzy was very friendly.
1178106,41245531,2015-08-05,37913979,Aaron,I only stayed one night. But the place was clean and Izzy was very friendly 
1178106,41426123,2015-08-07,25714505,Rachael,"Clean, close to airport, nice hosts. Would stay here again!"
1178106,41810426,2015-08-09,17816681,Sara,"Izzy's place was as described and easy to find. I was a little surprised by the surrounding neighborhood; it didn't feel as safe as I would have liked. However, the actual street and house were fine. The room had a window A/C too!  "
1178106,42027435,2015-08-10,3474750,Joanne,This room was ideal for our purpose. We flew into Boston at a very late hour and needed somewhere to sleep until we could take the bus home on the final leg of our vacation (URL HIDDEN) host has easy-to-follow instructions on how to find the place from the airport and how to gain access into the house. I would probably choose somewhere else if I was going to be staying for more than one night.
1178106,42198243,2015-08-11,5181752,Gina,"The room is exactly as described: cozy, clean, comfortable, and close to the airport stop on the T. The section of town is a bit grittier than I was expecting, but I did not feel unsafe. Izzy gave very clear check-in instructions, and everything went smoothly even though he was not there on premises. We REALLY appreciated being able to leave our luggage at the house even after check-out so we didn't have to carry it around town all day. If you're looking for a reliable, professional option close to the T and the airport, this place is highly recommended!"
1178106,42323622,2015-08-12,4107208,Dan,"My stay was great! It was a sparse, but comfortable room: perfect if you just need somewhere to sleep prior to catching a flight. I was allowed to check out late and hang out in the wifi enabled common room, too!"
1178106,42443647,2015-08-13,36813099,Jessica,"I didn't meet Izzy but he was upfront and let me know when attempting to make the booking that the room was small and price reflected conventions in town.  Very clear directions about arrival and very walkable to airport shuttle/public transit. First room at the top of the stairs is noisy when guests arrive late at night (due to creaky stairs/thin walls?) Very nice to allow us to leave our bags after check out, since our flight wasn't until later that evening!"
1178106,42591382,2015-08-14,38301688,杨,That house is very convenient to go to the light rail and airport shuttle bus station. lzzy gave us a password before our arrival. That room is comfortable and clean. We'd like to stay there again in future.
1178106,43572663,2015-08-20,40784213,Neelima,Got all the details I needed from Izzy in a timely fashion. Had no difficulty finding the place and checking in. The listing description is fairly accurate; I appreciated the fact that the place was very clean and guests were required to leave their footwear downstairs in the cabinet so as not to carry dirt all over the place. The neighborhood was very nice and appeared safe. Lots of nice restaurants around. The only issue I had was that my friend who brought me over had a hard time finding parking.
1178106,43838069,2015-08-22,18048420,Maxime,"This place is like a mini youth hostel, with rooms and public spaces, located in the hispanic populated part of Boston (East Boston), about 5 minutes walk to the closest metro. Although we didn't meet Izzy in person, we had good indications on how to get in the place and what to do. The room we were in (Room A) was small, but had air conditioning and had a good bed. Finally, we had a good time at Izzy's, and Angela's Cafe nearby was a good guess for breakfast."
1178106,44315463,2015-08-25,35064082,Caitlin,"The location was perfect! Only a few blocks from the airport T station, which was extremely convenient for arrival and departure. Only a few stops on the T to get into the heart of Boston to do all the tourist activities. Izzy was flexible with our check-in/check-out due to flight times, allowing us to drop our bags off early before check-in and to leave our bags after check-out until our flight left. The fully stocked kitchen with a coffee station guests were free to use was a nice touch. The room was quite small but cozy, and it was perfect for what we were looking for as we only used the Izzy's home as a place to sleep and shower. There was only one bathroom to be shared between several guests staying in the multiple rooms, but we rarely ran into a problem getting in when we needed to.  We had a wonderful time!"
1178106,44677628,2015-08-28,30356463,Wayne,The room and location were as described. There was also an air conditioner which helped on the hot evenings. There was often a queue for the bathroom however it was not too long. There was always hot water when I needed it. I would stay here again. 
1178106,44979370,2015-08-30,26418944,Gaelle,"Izzy's place was very convenient and it felt as if he has put a lot of thought into making his guests feel welcome.  I parked my rental car around noon and walked to the T stop (about 1/2 mile away) to explore the city, and didn't return until long after dark, but it was easy to navigate and I always felt safe.   I didn't get a chance to meet him, but he provided clear and thorough instructions and I had no problem finding the house, my room, the wireless password and everything.  Several other people were staying at the house, and everyone was friendly, considerate and welcoming.  There's an amazing and authentic mexican cafe about 2 blocks away that one guest recommended for breakfast -- one of the best meals of my entire trip.  Would definitely stay there again!"
1178106,45470997,2015-09-03,36518136,Marina,"Izzy's place was very convenient and well located, the room was clean and big enough for a comfy bed and a desk. Common areas were great too, I loved the patio the most. Only thing was that, due to the extreamly hot weather, the AC had to stay on all night and unfortunately it's very noisy. . Hadn't the chance to meet Izzy, but was in good company with a few other guests. Overall a nice stay, I suggest the place."
1178106,45578460,2015-09-04,39382323,Sofia,"I had a very short stay at Izzy's place but it worked great. Very close to the airport, and very convenient if you need to check in late and check out early. As it says in the ad, the room is very cozy but if you don't plan on spending much time there, it's great. Plus, it's got a very spacious kitchen and living room if you do plan on spending some time at the home. Also, Izzy was great at responding quite quickly to messages. "
1178106,45809412,2015-09-06,38647629,Dan,Izzy is a gracious host and great to talk with.  His place is warm and inviting..excellent location!
1178106,46907243,2015-09-14,3478186,Bjorn,Just as described and conveniently located to the airport. Izzy was friendly and laid-back
1178106,47371025,2015-09-18,40568194,Lisa,"I would definitely stay here again if I have an early departure or late arrival from Logan airport, since the location is super convenient. The neighborhood seems very safe (I arrived late at night) although it is a little tricky to find the apartment at night because the park by the T stop near the apartment closes its gates at night so you have to walk around.  Izzy was very prompt at responding to my many inquiries, as my plans were changing. 
The room itself is very small, as described,but the bed is actually bigger than it looks in the photo (full size instead of single bed).  Which means that you have more room in the bed but less space in the room than you might imagine."
1178106,47506087,2015-09-19,1216578,Manuela,"Great location, very close to the airport was a short walk to the bus stop. We only stayed one night but the it was perfect, room was very cozy - would definitely recommend "
1178106,47796688,2015-09-21,7044030,Danielle,"Just as described - cozy room, nothing fancy. Neighborhood has some great restaurants but it's a different atmosphere than downtown Boston. "
1178106,48316140,2015-09-25,30359726,Ana,"Izzy was there to great us upon arrival at around 6 pm. He was helpful at giving us recommendations for dinner and a great location for a view of the skyline. 
The room was as described. A very small room on the second floor of the house. The bed wasn't very comfortable and the room didn't have a pleasant odor. The room could use a mirror since the bathroom is shared by multiple guest and Izzy's family. 
Our light was out the first night we arrived and past midnight by the time we noticed so we didn't bother contacting Izzy to fix it that night. We did however message the him and he fixed it before our return to the room that second night. It did however take him a reminder and several hours for him to even acknowledge our request to have the light change. 
Overall we had a decent stay. The room is perfect if you are on a budget and will only need the room to sleep and store your luggage.  "
1178106,48416751,2015-09-26,42427398,Huimeng,"Izzy made a clear introduction on how to get his house, which is quite closed to the airport. Very good choice for people who have early flights:)"
1178106,48719168,2015-09-28,41145665,Philippe,"Accueil de piètre qualité, Izzy a été présent durant cinq minutes, le temps de délégué son jeune frère pour nous montrer la chambre et nous donner de trop maigres informations. Chambre très petite où le manque d'aération occasionne une odeur désagréable. 
Place insuffisante pour le rangement des bagages.
Une salle de bain pour, au moins six personnes.
Nous avons du mal a comprendre  que les avis s'accordent à donner 5 étoiles à cette  maison qui, pour nous a été le pire logement de notre  voyage se composant de sept étapes. 
"
1178106,48886122,2015-09-29,40390662,Claire,"Izzy was so kind and welcoming. He rents a few rooms and runs the house very professionally, it was spotless and comfortable. He was great to talk to! "
1178106,49619515,2015-10-05,17415675,Jane,"I didn't get to meet Izzy until I was checking out in the morning, but he was lovely and very helpful with directions to get into town. 
House was as described, easy to get to and self 'check in' had really clear instructions. "
1178106,50323002,2015-10-11,43901643,Michael,"What we liked: the location. Although the neighbourhood is a little bit sketchy and dirty, we didn’t have any negative experience with the locals. As advertised, the room is about 5-6 minutes away from the MBTA station and the Airport shuttle.

What we didn’t like: the room is extremely-extremely small – there is no place for two people to stand in it; one has to sit down. It has a non-standard size, very short, self-made “bed” with a poor quality mattress. The owner mentioned that the house is professionally cleaned, but we saw some traces of bare feet on the floor when we checked in. We also saw some old UPS packaging and rugs on the front porch that looked like being there for a while. Therefore, I would question the professional cleaning statement. The main floor and bathroom are reasonably clean, though.

Bottom line: I would not recommend renting this specific room for two people or taller people (I’m 6’2”). Nevertheless, the other two guest rooms on the second floor are much bigger and have normal beds in them.
"
1178106,50874685,2015-10-15,2173929,Andrew,"Izzy wasnt there but there was a nice young guy called Jake over-seeing things.
The room was small comfy and fine. Bathroom clean with a nice hot shower. Kitchen was good.. Hostel feel with coffee and tea and biscuits that people had left behind available for communal use.
Nice mellow safe neighbourhood with useful shops and eateries around.
Close to airport.
Sure its pricey for a small room but i guess this is the north eastern US and thats the market - with average hotel rooms at 200+ dollars.
I can recommend this place. "
1178106,51303153,2015-10-19,30873414,Allison,"The description was definitely accurate with the size of the room.  The room was VERY cozy.  We were not even able to lay down our suitcase and open it up on the floor.  Very tight space.  

The other parts of the house were not very clean as advertised.  In the directions, it said to clean up after yourself in the kitchen and bathroom which were both a mess.  When we arrived late Friday night, the kitchen was full of dirty dishes."
1178106,51595691,2015-10-21,21362923,Gay Lynn,"The host was very welcoming and accommodating.  Enjoyed the stay!  It did take a while to find parking (maybe if people arrive in the day rather than the evening, there's more parking in this residential neighborhood?) "
1178106,51835459,2015-10-24,17944486,Yuran,directions are clear. location is good. pretty close to airport. excellent price for one stay in boston!
1178106,52095876,2015-10-26,44885770,Vanessa,"I had a wonderful experience during my stay in Boston. The house was very warm and cozy, true to its description. I visited Boston with one of my friends and even though the room was small, it fit all of our needs. Jacob was an absolute pleasure to meet. He is awesome company and helped us with anything he could. I'd definitely stay again. "
1178106,53032231,2015-11-03,25757141,Lolly,Great spot near airport 
1178106,53725910,2015-11-11,8214532,Rob,"From the moment I enter the space, I realized the strong welcoming vibe to all guests in a shared space was very palpable! It starts with a warm and smiling friendly host, Jacob, who made us all feel at home. There was random engaging banter with other guests making for an awesome stay in a very strategic space with an unexpected bonus, new friends -- awesome!!"
1178106,53960442,2015-11-15,88128,Alan,"The room was exactly as I'd hoped, small but clean and comfortable. Very handy for the airport and some interesting S American restaurants nearby."
1178106,54363800,2015-11-18,933,Jill,"This place was PERFECT for my needs and saved me big time.   It was great that you can walk there from the airport (from where the airport shuttle drops you at the Blue Line)  I was traveling back from Paris after the attacks and my flight from Boston to Denver was canceled due to an expected snow storm.  I was so lucky to find this perfect, close, affordable place!  I would have loved to stay up and chat with the other, friendly guests there, but I was beat.   There are 4 rooms in this listing and one bathroom, but it presented no problems for me.  Nice kitchen and living room.  If you go to a highly recommended Italian restaurant a couple of blocks away, Rino's, I highly recommend splitting a  meal.   They served me about 2 pounds of pasta in a giant bowl.  "
1178106,54714745,2015-11-23,45249411,Shinji,"Just as described.
Good location, Good room!"
1178106,54806041,2015-11-23,48484486,Katie,Clean pleasant place to stay. Host appears to not live in the house so did not meet him. Would stay again. 
1178106,55481503,2015-12-01,10146571,Audrey,Izzy's house is very friendly and we enjoyed our stay in Chicago.
1178106,56287933,2015-12-11,49791278,Harvey Kung (鉑凱),"With Izzy`s clear instruction, I was able to reach his place easily. Also his rule and guide toward everyone is very complete and I think everything here is well organized. What`s more, they have a full-time house keeper here. Everything is gooooood!!"
1178106,56575464,2015-12-14,33946392,Jeongyeon,"His room was cozy, has good location. He responded me quickly whenever i sent him a msg. Nice experience!"
1178106,56700194,2015-12-16,50992499,Moiz,It's definitely easy to get to from the airport. Pretty accurate description. Room was small but clean. Bed was comfortable. There were fresh towels available. Bathroom was fairly neat and tidy. Overall I think this is a great place to stay at and the host is very easy to get in touch with. The iron in the basement did a fantastic job in preparing my suit for the interview I was in Boston for. 
1178106,56745521,2015-12-17,4888959,Evan,"The check in was very simple and well explained, I never met Izzy and it was a short reservation and yet all components worked well and there were no concerns. The house was simple and comfortable. The house is old and the stairs can be very noisy and sounds carry from other guests in other rooms. Not the quietest location. The location is however right next to the airport and very quick metro to the downtown Boston area!"
1178106,57277379,2015-12-23,32288039,Chris,"Great place to crash after a loooong flight delay! Clean, close to the airport, and the price was right. "
1178106,57354346,2015-12-24,4599172,Sophia,"The location was incredibly convenient for traveling to the airport. A very reasonable walk to the airport shuttle, even with suitcases. And, Izzy provided clear directions for getting into the room and to/from the house.

Especially if you are a light sleeper, you should know that sound travels very easily throughout the house. This room is right in front of the staircase, so I could hear footsteps every time someone went up and down the stairs, and I could hear voices of the other guests (not sure if they were downstairs or in their rooms).  "
1178106,57471139,2015-12-26,50389225,Grace,The location is close to the airport:)
1178106,58713950,2016-01-03,4433923,Nicholas,The room was quite basic and allowed me to have quick access to Logan. 
1178106,58738737,2016-01-04,52461251,Kathy,My host was very informative .  The room was comfortable and the location was exactly what I was looking for . 
1178106,59027352,2016-01-05,52560388,John,"Great place, great host! Small but cozy room, just a few blocks from the train station. Would definitely stay here again! "
1178106,60928704,2016-01-29,32236455,Chuong,"Great place to stay. The room was nice, the bathroom was great, and the laundry facilities were a fantastic addition. The hosts were also very friendly and fantastic. Highly recommended."
1178106,61002558,2016-01-30,4094058,Shawn,"Close to the airport and the train. Easy to get to. Great, quiet neighborhood. 

Welcoming home and great, efficient communication from our host."
1178106,61127230,2016-01-31,56286148,Monica,"Cozy and comfortable. I felt safe and at home inside, (important for a female traveling alone;) but I was in the neighborhood late at night and did not feel super safe walking the street (parking is hit or miss.). If you are traveling with someone else or just feel comfortable in the city streets, then this place is great. The host was awesome, and overall, I would stay again."
1178106,61499396,2016-02-05,38257347,Nicholas,Arrived to a clean room. Towel folded on the bed. Seems like they have their act together. 
1178106,61587752,2016-02-06,55736575,Allison,"The neighborhood seemed safe - my flight landed around 11:40 PM on a Thursday night and the street was quiet. The entrance to the T and the airport shuttles are about 4 or 5 blocks away from the house but I would recommend a taxi or Uber for late night traversing. The air conditioning unit did not work and the house was very hot - which was fine for a cold winter night, but I wish that I had brought a hand-held fan. There were towels folded neatly on my bed and the bathroom amenities were thoughtful. Overall, a satisfying stay!"
1178106,61672463,2016-02-07,54751096,Kristian,It was a chill experience. I would stay there again. Thanks Izzy!
1178106,61772327,2016-02-08,49470328,Yaokai,"The room was accurately described, although I wouldn't say this is terrific value. It is the most reasonably priced. Room was on the small side, no desks, just a bed. 
Works fine as an overnight stay though. Host was welcoming, and the place was reasonably clean, too. 
Parking on the street wasn't too easy but not too bad either. "
1178106,63266366,2016-02-21,23748354,Ronjon,"Izzy's an amazing host, there's a reason I've stayed at his place multiple times. Great experience as always :)"
1178106,63319508,2016-02-22,25240169,Gary,"Perfect place for a short/medium stay. Within walking distance from the airport T Station. Izzy gives very good directions. Clean rooms, use of kitchen if necessary. The housekeeper is wonderful and helpful. A little noisy as the walls are thin,  but a great deal nonetheless. Izzy replied promptly to all emails. "
1178106,64657227,2016-03-06,49460311,Sarah,"The description was accurate and it was an easy check-in process. Bed was comfortable and the small closet was a nice feature. Only downside was its location next to the stairs (which are super noisy)- allowed for you to hear all traffic up and down them as well as anything going on downstairs. Overall a comfortable stay.

1178106,65697819,2016-03-16,51420001,Nina,This the most  wonderful experience in Airbnb I've ever had
1178106,65720894,2016-03-16,4129475,Mehmet,Everything was as they were described in the listing and shown in the photos. 
1178106,66121243,2016-03-19,2384877,Snow,Rosa (the lady that met us in the house) was very nice and the place if very close to the airport.  You can easily walk from the MBTA.  This is a great place to stay if you have an early flight.  Don't look for fancy services and chocolate on your pillows at night.  But your not paying for chocolate or services either.  Thanks Rosa and Izzy - worked well for me and my boy. 
1178106,67040284,2016-03-26,50660835,Sunshine,that room was really stuffy and small.. also I had to share a bathroom with even 4~5 people but it's clean!
1178106,67302967,2016-03-28,12681517,Danielle,This is the second time I stayed at Izzy's Airbnb and it was great! My room was exactly as described.  I interacted with other visitors who were very kind and considerate with shared spaces. Thanks for another great stay Izzy!
1178106,69494277,2016-04-11,2007252,Jonathan,"Easy check in/check out. Host was very pleasant, room was basic but clean, and good location to catch uber to and from airport. "
1178106,69719812,2016-04-12,45589363,Tom,Izzy was a great host and delivered as promised. Great location if you need to get into Boston or be close to airport. Bedroom is small but bed comfortable. Perfect for in and out.
1178106,69763909,2016-04-13,6758049,Justin,"This is my 3rd time staying here because it is so comfortable and convenient. Proximity to airport, cleanliness, friendliness of host, bed and room comfort are just some of the reasons I stay at Izzy's."
1178106,69889327,2016-04-14,20514191,Feyaad,"Stayed for one night before leaving on an early flight. The place had all the basic necessities and seems like a place to just stay for one night. Neighborhood isn't lively you have to take the T to get to the more busy parts of Boston. Place was exactly as described. If you just need a place to stay near the airport, I recommend. "
1178106,70668652,2016-04-19,49285340,Patti,I loved the location and the people!  Evelina was so warm and welcoming.  
1178106,72967725,2016-05-05,69396680,Wilson,"The directions were foolproof. I was able to find the house at night without difficulty, even though I had never been to East Boston before.

I liked seeing my name on the whiteboard. Simple as it was, it made me feel that I was expected and that someone had made arrangements for me.

The room was, as promised, cozy in size but also very clean and tidy. The bed was perhaps a little too soft, but my back felt fine in the morning."
1178106,73850731,2016-05-10,47438842,Reinhard,Check-in and out was very uncomplicated (we arrived before normal check-in and it was no problem to deposit our luggage). The house has four rooms which are Airbnb'd. Kitchen and bathrooms shared as described. Kitchen is well equipped and there is a large fridge. The room itself was kind of small (as described) but perfect for us as we just came there for sleep. There is also a big shared living room. Perfect connection to subway (~10mins to city) and free airport bus.
1178106,74273658,2016-05-14,43087727,Long,The location of the house is perfect. It is very suitable for the people who wants to catch up the early flight. The house is clean and I feel so comfortable in the house. Lzzy is a very nice host and he give the response in time. 
1178106,75055402,2016-05-18,45946638,Julia,"I needed a place to stay some days before going back to Brazil and I found Izzy's place. The room is nice, it is small but it was enough for me. The house is close to MBTA Airport Station, which makes things easier. "
1178106,78432795,2016-06-06,56442974,Jan,"Perfect place to stay in Boston! Thanks Izzy, Flávio, and Isabel for the warm welcome! "
1178106,78841050,2016-06-09,76249289,Tamas,"Izzy has a nice setup where everything is well laid out and streamlined, which made everything very simple. It's a bit cramped, but the price is right and I would definitely stay there again for a quick stopover."
1178106,79491162,2016-06-13,47278588,Yating,"The location is great and really close to airport. So if you have to catch up a flight early in the morning and only needs a quick stay, it works. The room is as small as it can be and there are four tiny rooms on the second floor. We could hear others coming up the stairs and talking in their rooms. The bedding is grey instead of the white and red color in the picture so it's really hard to tell whether it's clean. "
1178106,80644094,2016-06-19,74800570,Mandy,"The lady who greeted me, not the host, was sweet but the price was very steep for the condition of the property and the neighbourhood."
1178106,80940649,2016-06-20,39978706,Isaac,"The instructions to reach the house were clear, and I was capable to get there fast after I arrived at Boston.

The house was in very good conditions, and it was a quiet neighborhood.

The room was clean and of good size. I really liked staying there, and will consider it for future trips."
1178106,81489776,2016-06-23,73931498,Jen,"Izzy's place was just like described and worked for what I needed. I was in town for one night and needed to be close to the airport. The room was clean and he provided clean towels and linens for the bed, the bed was comfy. I even got to do laundry there which was nice! Nice, local restaurants within walking distance. "
1178106,81562765,2016-06-23,71644747,Haiting,We chose it because it is very close to the airport. The house is very clean and private and we had a good time!
1178106,82370717,2016-06-27,20546271,Jasper,"I stayed here during a layover in Boston, so I came in late and left early.
The room is basic but very comfortable, the location is super-convenient, and the neighbourhood very nice.

1178106,82778757,2016-06-29,6758049,Justin,Always love staying here!
1178106,82939959,2016-06-30,64072762,Kristian,Warm and inviting place conveniently located near the airport.
1178106,83280136,2016-07-02,34493934,Nilakshi,"The room where stayed in was small, but it was advertised as small. The only thing I didn't notice in the description was that the room has vaulted ceilings which made it look even smaller in realty. 

The room was clean, and was quiet. There is a little area by the kitchen where we had our meals, and it is nice."
1178106,83611744,2016-07-03,24579873,Hanh,"The house was very close to the airport, and the instructions how to get were very straightforward. The room was small, but the airconditioning/fan definitely made a difference in the summer. Izzy was not there, but his cousin was really friendly and the check in/out process was very smooth. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely consider his place for future trips to Boston. "
1178106,84094731,2016-07-05,75578478,Athena,"Great room, clean and air conditioned; which was a plus because it was 87 degrees on the day we stayed. Perfect directions, and nothing negative to note."
1178106,84300452,2016-07-06,7270259,Nicole,"Very friendly host (who was not Izzy, but his cousin).  I booked this space at the last minute during a layover and I couldn't have asked for a more convenient location, etc.  10/10 would book again!"
1178106,84858776,2016-07-09,81688077,Maddy,This was our first time using Airbnb and it was a perfect welcome. We arrived early and the man who was cleaning the house went and got our room ready even though it was only 10:30am. He was very friendly and the house was very clean and welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay in Boston and would stay here again next time. 
1178106,85647107,2016-07-12,13777673,Jocelyn,The location is close to the airport. The room looks the same as the pictures. Izzy is responsive and nice. It's a convenient place for a layover in Boston.
1178106,86155380,2016-07-15,72383365,Kim,This is a self-check-in home with about five bedrooms. The other Airbnb guests were so friendly and welcoming yet understood privacy of each guest. The place is immaculate. And the neighborhood is a lovely working-class place. Wifi is good. Great (great!) Mexican restaurant just around the corner plus a corner grocery-store for snacks and necessities.
1178106,86413864,2016-07-16,70849065,Madison,great for a quick overnight stay.
1178106,86844572,2016-07-17,49503832,Robert,Great apartment and very close to the airport! Izzy makes your traveling quite easy with easy to use instructions and timely communication. Clean and comfortable place! Would definitely stay again.
1178106,87081997,2016-07-18,21821326,Courtney,Izzy's place is absolutely perfect for anyone wanting to be close to the airport!! I'd stay again in a second!
1178106,87311938,2016-07-19,8755661,Stephanie,"The room was clean and comfortable. The house was full but noise was not an issue. The apartment is extremely close to the airport, which is very convenient. Those with early departures should note, however, that Bremen Street Park is gated and locked before daylight--making the walk to the Airport T station much longer. (I gave up and called an Uber). "
1178106,87817456,2016-07-22,23752681,Lydia,Convenient location. Clean home! Thank you!
1178106,87928100,2016-07-22,39606237,Devin,"Cozy home which worked well for our short stay. Would use again if I had another early flight from Logan.
"
1178106,88792013,2016-07-25,50018581,David,Good location and accurate description
1178106,89148464,2016-07-27,38231611,Liam,"This place is exactly as it is described. If you want a place to rest your head for a night and be close to the airport and city centre - then you can't go past this place for value.

I stayed for one night after arriving in Boston after a 24hr flight and its location and comfort couldn't be better, and the host - izzie's cousin -  was incredibly friendly and helpful."
1178106,91576717,2016-08-06,72067606,Nicole,Had a nice stay with Izzy. Felt a bit more like a hostel but with private rooms. Grateful for the aircon. Easy access to train. Izzy was easy to communicate with. Boston was a great city to check out on our holiday! 
1178106,91921745,2016-08-07,23870899,Ryan,Izzy was great. It was super easy to get to the airport to catch my morning flight  without needing to Uber. Would definitely stay there again.
1178106,92260169,2016-08-08,8482592,Ben,Easy checkin and housing location. Arrived from the airport and was in my room within half an hour. Good night stay! Absolutely perfect for quick stays near the airport.
1178106,92549200,2016-08-09,75188393,Zihan,Good location near the airport and a nice place to chill with interesting people. 
1178106,92720227,2016-08-09,50649026,Courtney,"quiet quaint place, nice location from airport (before park closes) otherwise will have to take uber for 6 dollars (still cheap) clean place. very nice host."
1178106,92972037,2016-08-10,37231606,Julie,"Izzy was an excellent host!  The directions to his house were easy to understand, the location was close to the airport, the room and house were clean, and the bed was comfortable.  You can tell he takes pride in providing a quality experience for all of the residents and is very welcoming.  I enjoyed meeting Izzy and others staying in his residence and would suggest booking with Izzy to anyone looking for a Boston layover or as a base for exploring the city (T station is only a few blocks away)."
1178106,94382387,2016-08-15,88817086,Hyejin,All the description give was accurate. 
1178106,95630082,2016-08-20,70816574,Yuhuang,Very good 
1178106,95666339,2016-08-20,22243255,Alvito,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1178106,95944743,2016-08-21,68885094,Clark,Izzy was super helpful. Bed was comfortable. Great experience!
1178106,96516202,2016-08-23,4413393,Gabriela,Izzy & his guests are super nice. Very convenient location. Walking distance from airport shuttle & T-line. I loved their welcome sign. The coffee station is a nice touch. I enjoyed my stay. Thank you.
1178106,97215139,2016-08-26,39498429,He,Good and clean .will love to come back again .easy go ️
1178106,97656278,2016-08-28,28984407,Niek,"Izzy's assistant was great! Had a good time here, it was even no problem that I would check-out later on the day!
Noise from the Airport is not too bad. Very close to the Airport (T), pretty convinient!"
1178106,98777943,2016-09-01,37352445,Alexander,"It was our first booking with Airbnb. 

And we where curious after a looong flight and looooong immigration about the new temporary home.

The House is clean and  the Pictures matches the room correctly

One small hint, we think for 2 People including Packages it might be too small. The other rooms are much more comfortable.

For one it will be good!

Location is GREAT, really close to airport, easy reachable by Bus, Tube and Car. 

A big Supermarket will be 5 Minutes walk away.

Finally we think it is recommenable and the price is cheap. 

Thanks

Alex"
1178106,99125204,2016-09-03,90444315,Lisa,Die Unterkunft ist sehr nah am Flughafen und sehr sauber.  Wir haben alle Informationen vorab erhalten.
1178106,99501855,2016-09-05,58496779,Morgane,"Tout correspondait à la description, aucun souci ! 
Situé pas loin d'un métro ce qui était bien pratique. "
1178106,99664579,2016-09-05,11213194,Grace,My stay here was great! Izzy provided easy to follow check-in instructions and the room was quite small but very clean and comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen were also very tidy and well maintained. Overall a pleasant experience! :)
1178106,100303067,2016-09-08,21688712,Kateryna,The stay was great and as expected. Thank you! 
1178106,101297618,2016-09-12,3458485,Yusef,"Izzy was attentive and we didn't have to wait long despite the fact that we only booked about 4 hours in advance. Early morning flight the next day meant we needed a reliable place to stay that wasn't the hotel, and Izzy definitely delivered. He accomodate and made us feel welcome. Size of room was a bit on the small side and we lucked out having no loud room mates, though there were 3 other rooms crammed in next to hours, would hate to think what would have happened with loud late night arrivals. Would probably want to know that in the listing next time, but overall very satisfied. Location was an inherent plus as we could get to the airport within minutes without driving. Very convenient if you are flying in and out of boston."
1178106,101482771,2016-09-13,90287335,Fernando,"Location was good though the description could have been more accurate. The cozy room is a small space (I'm 5'5 and hit my head on the roof when walking near the small desk). The place is okay if I were traveling for pleasure but for business travel, I'll skip rooms like these unless desperate.

Otherwise, Izzy was a good host and gave good recommendations for food."
1178106,102146655,2016-09-17,41020506,César,"Everything was perfect. They helped us to find every place and transportation that we want to visit. They care about everything and the place was perfect and also only 3 stops from the city center. If we return to Boston, we will definitely be there."
1178106,102277924,2016-09-17,20273093,紫薇,It is a wonder space. I have a good sleeping in here. 
1178106,102612876,2016-09-18,95484997,Roxana,"It's very close to Logan's Airport and its T station which is convenient!
The room was very small and the ventilation was not good but it works for a night. Izzy was very kind!"
1178106,102894127,2016-09-19,41618881,Urtė,"The place was convenient to reach by subway. Clean and cozy house. However, room was not so spacious as it was shown in pictures. "
1178106,103094197,2016-09-20,95337960,Радомир,"From the moment we entered the place he greeted us with a smile!
He was very helpful with directions as well.The rooms were clean and cozy as described.Im looking forward to come back.Until next time Izzy :) "
1178106,103444090,2016-09-22,21984974,Vera,"Very convenient location -close to the airport and metro station. The room is very small, but cozy and clean. Izzy is a very nice host.Thank you!"
1178106,104805885,2016-09-28,96640541,Eziz,"Convenient location, clean and affordable. Would definitely "
1178106,104947707,2016-09-29,93050915,Phil,"I had an early morning flight out of Logan and Izzy's place was exactly what I was looking for.  Close, clean & comfortable!  

I did have a rental car and the one thing to watch is the street parking. Many of the streets in East Boston are restricted to permit parking for the residents. It took me a while, but I finally found an area just a few blocks away that did not require a permit. 

All good "
1178106,105361049,2016-10-01,65931699,Leandro,"Ótimo lugar para se hospedar, eu fiquei pouco tempo na casa, ela é bem limpa, ótima localização, ótima opção para ficar em Boston"
1178106,105658498,2016-10-02,91191250,Neil,"Very clean place, easy enough to find.  Parking was scarce but we got lucky with a spot out front.  Far from downtown but i guess its close enough to the airport.  Room A is small and there are potentially 3 other couples in the house at the same time so be prepared for the lack of privacy.  at the end of the day, the value was great and i felt comfortable with how clean the place was."
1178106,105963921,2016-10-03,63101908,Aj,"I didn't expect anything extravagant with this room, and that is exactly what I got. Parking was a hassle,  but  otherwise everything went relatively smoothly. "
1178106,106322451,2016-10-05,88354120,Andrew,The host was warm and welcoming and the amenities provided was fantastic. Would visit them again.
1178106,106864065,2016-10-08,5778603,Sreekanth,I haven't met Izzy but he left detailed description and details on how to access the house.
1178106,109133830,2016-10-19,430276,Heather,"Izzy was great and helpful, and this was very conveniently close to the airport. I didn't realize that it was pretty much like a youth hostel though and would have liked more space and privacy and quiet for the price. "
1178106,109430613,2016-10-21,60613867,Andrea,"close to the airport, convenient location. everything went well. "
1178106,110327130,2016-10-25,3626700,Mike,Perfect little room to crash in before an early flight the next morning. Everything was as described. Thanks Izzy
1178106,110645595,2016-10-27,75444288,Sheren,"I never met Izzy during my stay but his assistant Lena was there. She was extremely helpful and welcoming. Lena assured me that as a single female the area was safe for me to return from the T at night. This was very reassuring. She also gave me some useful information to help me during my stay. 

This Air B&B is well-located for Boston Logan airport and Downtown Boston. The neighbourhood is not smart so don't expect luxury but I was more than happy with the accommodation and welcome."
1178106,110791433,2016-10-28,40892289,Alex,Great value of course. Izzy was very accommodating.
1178106,111534528,2016-10-31,23748354,Ronjon,"I've stayed at Izzy's a bunch of times when I've come to Boston. Walking distance from the airport, no issues whatsoever with anything. Nice place, thank you so much for continuing to host."
1178106,111758103,2016-11-01,25325878,Carlos,"Very nice place area located in East Boston not far from restaurants on Chelsea st. 
Close to the airport Blue line.
Past guest left there unused ""T""
Cards near the front door for new guest. I'm very pleased and impress. Thank you Izzy & Lena"
1178106,112021072,2016-11-03,7256766,Alexander,"Never meet Izzy, but his assistant was super nice and kind. Check In was super easy.
The room is on the small side and fairly clean (as long as you don't look under the bed). The walls are thin, so you can hear the guests in the room next door snore...
It's almost impossible to find parking in the area."
1178106,112294355,2016-11-05,102128240,Kevin,Over all it was ok ....not what I was expecting.
1178106,112535764,2016-11-06,29995324,Linda,Izzy' place is perfect for a layover at Logan. 
1178106,113930211,2016-11-14,102269513,Luis,great place i didn't meet Izzi but the people i met were very friendly for sure if i need to come to Boston i will stay at Izzi house again
1178106,114085417,2016-11-15,60350402,Tabatha,"It was a great place to stay! Clean, convenient to airport, and great restaurants nearby."
1178106,115314110,2016-11-23,77256511,Raj,"I enjoyed my stay at Izzy's place. The location is highly convenient - it's a short walk to the T station, grocery and other stores. The room and the house was immaculate. I did not get to meet Izzy face to face but she responded to my emails quickly. All in all, this place offers a good value for money and I will   definitely stay at Izzy's again."
1178106,116335958,2016-11-29,77256511,Raj,This was my second stay at Izzy's. And I just booked her place for my upcoming third trip. Highly recommended !
1178106,116543438,2016-12-01,102023076,Fred,Great spot for a quick stay!
1178106,116672299,2016-12-02,20372096,Lindsey,"A convenient place to stay if you've got a flight but still want to see Boston. Walking distance to the airport T station. Overall, nice stay! "
1178106,116781934,2016-12-03,56031856,Laura,"It was perfect for me to catch my flight out early the next morning. Simple place, good price, exactly what I was looking for. "
1178106,120729493,2016-12-11,32388266,Anthony,Great place to stay while in Boston. Clean and the self-check in allowed me to relax since I went to see my friend first and couldn't actually get to the room til late.
1178106,121026947,2016-12-13,13977556,Jenny,Check in was a breeze and I had plenty of privacy. 
1178106,121362011,2016-12-16,99818210,Annabelle,"The place was what you pay for. The room is dingy and small, and the bed was not very comfortable because of the blankets. There was no heating (at least I was never told any instructions to central heating) so I just delt with it. It must've been 60 degrees inside if not less, and the blankets provided were extremely thin. Had to sleep with my jeans and jacket on. For one nights stay this is very ideal because it is close to the T station and affordable. Not good for couples because there are two neighboring rooms with other guests, and you can hear them talk and move through the walls. There are also the sounds from the airport, which didn't bother me but just FYI for anybody who might be sensitive. "
1178106,121904153,2016-12-19,107396026,Gerlin,"Did not meet host, but everything went very smoothly. Very close to airport and the bed was so comfy! Would definitely stay again for the great price. "
1178106,122031156,2016-12-20,106553449,Shirleys,convenient location near airport and downtown. Clean and tidy bedroom.
1178106,122595853,2016-12-24,75237361,Chris,"It's very near the airport, fantastic!"
1178106,123286294,2016-12-28,32615663,Alison,"The house was easily accessible from the airport and subway station but the walk from station through the neighborhood did not have me feeling really safe but maybe it was since at 5:30 it was already pitch black outside. I did a self-checkin so I never met Izzy but he left plenty of detailed instructions on directions to the house, codes to get in, house rules, ect. The place seemed clean enough but it's an older house that's a little run down so with all the mention of cleanliness in the description I was a little let down. The room I had was very small but works for a short one day stay here before moving on to my next location. You have a good amount of privacy and your own lock on the door but the walls are thin and you can easier hear other housemates and everything they do. The shared kitchen and bathroom while dated appeared well up kept. Izzy even supplies towels for a shower. Anyting over a small suitcase is a hassle to get up the tiny creaking stair to the room but one of the other guests was very kind and helped out with my bags. 
Overall it was a decent stay. The best thing about it was the closeness to the T station. 
"
1178106,123751071,2016-12-30,104572241,Keita,It was great.
1178106,124278006,2017-01-01,107945798,Ryo,過ごしやすく交通機関も徒歩7分ほどの距離に電車がありボストンまでなんなくいける
1178106,125391501,2017-01-05,67632591,Alexis,The entire process was very simple and easy. Izzy responded to my questions in a timely manner and it was a perfect accommodation to catch our early flight. 
1178106,125760117,2017-01-07,7269161,Andy,"Yes, welcome. I didn't get to visit the neighborhood, but it looks cool, with little restaurants. 
Parking was challenge. "
1178106,126007763,2017-01-08,104469943,Eduardo,"La ubicación es perfecta! Si vas del aeropuerto puedes tomar un shuttle desde Logan airport hasta la estación de la linea azul ""airport station""  y de ahi puedes ir caminando a casa, es un lugar super acogedor y impecablemente limpio. Me encanto muchísimo. Laura estuvo atenta y fue muy amable a cada detalle y estuvo dispuesta a ayudar en todo y a responder cualquier pregunta sobre mi viaje! La comunicación con el centro de la ciudad es buenísima! Este lugar es 100% recomendable!    
這個地方從機場真的很近!還有離城市坐捷運到家裡很方便!Laura小姐是一位很有禮貌的人!這個地方對我來說是最推薦這個地方!我非常非常喜歡!非常感謝Laura!"
1178106,126386843,2017-01-11,95443617,Jennifer,"I didn't really meet the host, the key just on the door. I did sleep well, the rest room and living room is clean. The place is very close to airport station, it just took me 5 minute walk to the station, and then there's free shuttle bus waiting for me. It is great to stay for a night!"
1178106,126503077,2017-01-12,37283873,Tiffany,Easy check-in. The house and room were very clean and comfortable. Highly recommend.
1178106,126652694,2017-01-13,48564360,Scott,As advertised; accurate reviews from others
1178106,126780094,2017-01-14,17268105,Daniel,"I think location wise, it is definitely ideal if you've got a night layover at Boston. However, the lack of stars were due to the loss of communication after informing the host that I've left an important belonging at the accommodation on departure. I've offered to pay for postage and the trouble but the host ended up ignoring any further emails. 

The house itself is mainly a place to put your head down. The room is basic but clean; toilet needs attention.

For the price, it's acceptable, that's all I can say

Host isn't great at communicating at times."
1178106,127459775,2017-01-18,7597750,Angela,"Straightforward check-in and close to public transportation. The room was as described, and it was a nice surprise to see such a well equipped kitchen and large common area, even though the room itself is quite cozy. Coffee and tea was available in the morning, which was a small touch that was greatly appreciated. The apartment is close to Logan airport, so I was lucky enough to get a ride through Uber for $3 instead of walking to the nearby airport shuttle since it was raining. I think the rooms were all booked, but it was so quiet it was hard to tell. I may have lucked out with that, as the walls were pretty thin and I think noise would carry between them. The only person I saw briefly was Izzy, who was friendly and not at all overbearing. Overall a great stay, and I think an especially good location for people traveling to and from the airport."
1178106,127583812,2017-01-19,28627870,Daniel,Awesome place and easy check in!
1178106,130687279,2017-02-07,84889310,Lou,"Great place to stay by the airport and the train stop. Quick 5 minute walk to the stop from the house. There's not much to do in East Boston, but the blue-line takes you into downtown to connect with the other lines. It's a great location for airport access and t-stop. "
1178106,131087727,2017-02-10,49307184,Jincheng,"Laura's place was very lovely. It was walkable from the Airport, so perfect for early flight. The neighbor was quiet. Though the weather was not good (a huge blizzard), but her house was still warm and very comfortable. I felt very relaxing to stay in the house. "
1178106,131541368,2017-02-12,114738504,Neeharika,"Room was a little small, only enough place for a bed. But you get what you pay for. 
Had a bathroom issue but was fixed so an extra star for cleaning up. The kitchen  was nice and spacious for having lunch/breakfast.
I had come in earlier than expected but they let me check in. So thank you!"
1178106,131754211,2017-02-13,97099521,Jose,"Cozy place, very convenient if you want something near the airport."
1178106,132850423,2017-02-19,11189204,Katelyn,"Good value, just be aware all other rooms in the house are rented out as well and there is only one bathroom for 4 rooms."
1178106,134497469,2017-02-27,74799132,Tevin,Very clean and peaceful!
1178106,135154895,2017-03-03,100098353,Tyler,"Izzy and Laura's place is a well kept older home, perfect for staying close to the airport with easy enough access to the rest of Boston and Cambridge by subway. Laura was present during my stay. She was an easy to reach and gracious host. Only issue you might have is that the house does carry noise and rents multiple rooms, so with several AirBnB travelers around you might be woken up once in a while. Wasn't an issue for me, but a light sleeper might look for something quieter."
1178106,135585626,2017-03-05,69945530,Felicitas," Close to the airport, easy check-in"
1178106,135968313,2017-03-07,24458451,Paul,This was easy and exactly what I was looking for. Totally makes sense as to why someone would stay here for a quick night. It was easy to get ready for work the next morning and head out the door on my way. Bed was very comfy and I felt safe. Thanks again!
1178106,136391185,2017-03-10,48853925,Freddie,Worth the price about a $6 Uber downtown 
1178106,137442289,2017-03-15,26132592,Cris,"Estuvieron pendientes de mi y del clima , mes dieron sugerencias y es un lugar muy tranquilo y limpio !! Sin duda lo recomiendo !! Esta a unos pocos minutos del aeropuerto :) "
1178106,137625023,2017-03-16,119831832,Kathryn,"This place was great, especially given that I had to be at the airport early in the morning. It was clean and private as advertised, and check-in was simple!"
1178106,138615186,2017-03-20,116160118,Yuchen,The environment and location are great!
1178106,138818522,2017-03-21,121305902,Logan,Very pleasant stay 
1178106,138948505,2017-03-22,119169041,Laura,"It was much cozier than I expected. The picture doesn't do it justice. My boyfriend and I barely had enough room  for our luggage. Not sure if it was in the description, but there is only one bathroom between 5 rooms, which changed our schedules around since someone was showering when we hoped to use the shower before our early morning flight. "
1178106,139086557,2017-03-23,39092944,Chen,It's a quite place and super close to airport. 
1178106,139273023,2017-03-24,15742643,Geena,"Really close to the airport and cool how I checked myself in. Feels more like an in and out kind of stop, especially since I stayed one night. Small room but good price. "
1178106,140523533,2017-03-30,112684870,Barbara,"Good for a shot stay, with everything you need.
I meet Camila and was very friendly and helpful. Great communication and excellent detail info.

The room is a little bit small.
Good communication from the airport. If you had and early fly the best is a uber ($6-$8), cause the park through you walk opens till 6/7am depending the season. 
"
1178106,140735739,2017-03-31,19930790,Aletta,Convenient for the airport!
1178106,141757475,2017-04-04,100277905,Christina,Place was great! We wanted something cheap that we could just come home to at night and leave in the morning to explore Boston! They responded so quickly and even let us leave our bags inside early the day we checked in so we could explore! The ceiling  is a tad low and we are small people so I had to bend down most of the time but that's hardly a complaint! Everything else was exactly what we needed! 
1178106,142108302,2017-04-06,64088356,Jennifer,"Close to airport station, nothing else nearby! Quiet and residential neighborhood. "
1178106,144401545,2017-04-15,57481318,M Lutfi,"Clean and simple room. Tidy and spacious kitchen and shared space. The shortcut to the airport through the park was locked at early morning, so make sure for those who have a morning flight. "
1178106,145547333,2017-04-18,61158970,Wesley,For the convenience of being so close the airport its just all worth it. Clean place and comfy bed for the quick check in and check out.
1178106,145738731,2017-04-19,10557202,Cody,Awesome hosts
1178106,146148324,2017-04-21,17334283,Tim,"Room/house were a little tighter than the photos depicted, but overall a great stay. Highly recommend for a place near the airport. "
1178106,146378915,2017-04-22,35418113,Ben,"Great directions, great arrival instructions, so easy to get to from the airport. Clean and secure."
1178106,148012668,2017-04-29,31301038,Laurens,"Hosts didn't reply to request to change reservation to two days later until 60hrs after request, denying the change. By which time I had already landed and was now marooned without accommodation. Also, contrary to the description, hosts don't live at the property. All four bedrooms are rented out for Airbnb. "
1178106,148388173,2017-04-30,29903334,Jiawen,nice location for just one-night stay
1178106,148921557,2017-05-01,128023482,John,"Close to the airport, good value. Some good restaurants nearby, walk to the shore you can get a nice view of Boston skylines."
1178106,149517848,2017-05-04,127062572,Jan-Christian,Very good and clear communication. Flexible check-in because of self check-in. Very good connection to downtown with blue line. The Room was small but comfortable.
1178106,150307648,2017-05-07,100849443,Johnny,Nice cosy house especially for single travellers/couples! 
1178106,150877668,2017-05-09,46715769,Heather,"I had a very simple and short stay in this home during a short layover. I'm always sure to read the reviews and all of the reviews for this space are accurate. The walls are very thin so it's true that you can very clearly hear the other guests which I found to be very annoying considering I'm a light sleeper. Beware if you suffer the same! The doors also are loud as people are shutting and locking them. The room is very small but the bed is comfortable and everything seemed clean and tidy. I did not use the kitchen but the bathroom is good yet the shower is not the greatest. Beware also that there is only ONE bathroom for four bedrooms! I had to use the bathroom very early in the morning but someone was in the shower so I had to wait. That was a bit frustrating! Overall, if you're aware of all of these aspects then the value of the room is fine. It's a nice place if you just need a place to crash that's close to the airport during a short layover. "
1178106,151048763,2017-05-10,26304140,Russell,"Great stay, very convenient to the airport. Place was very clean, and a little tight, as shown in the pictures. Sort of a micro-hostel vibe with the other 2 rooms, which is cool."
1178106,152046401,2017-05-14,33775267,Melissa,The room was very small and the other guests were noisy. The location to airport was good and for a quick overnight stay it worked out fine. 
1178106,152295109,2017-05-15,25757198,Keith,"Great location, close to the airport, decent value for the price, smaller than led on by the photos, and the time it took to find parking on the street was annoying. It wasn't a fancy place by any means. For a cheap place to stay, it works. Great communication by the host."
1178106,152653103,2017-05-17,129710085,Ruifeng,"很舒适的小屋,虽然起初会觉得有飞机噪声,但是晚上航班减少,所以不会有什么干扰。 最大的优势是距离机场很近… 房主会耐心回复短信,不错的"
1178106,154664555,2017-05-25,14227690,Alexandria,"Overall an easy and enjoyable stay. I just stayed one night and needed a comfortable place very close to the airport, and this fit the bill. The house was clean and quiet, the room was adequate, and I appreciated the thorough details and self check-in. The price was a little more than I would have expected, and the wifi was spotty, but otherwise I have nothing but praise for this listing!"
1178106,155185203,2017-05-27,110166431,以凝,"It's pretty close to the airport, not expensive, but the room is a bit too small. "
1178106,156707817,2017-05-31,114169493,Lixin,Had a 12 hour layover in Boston so I booked this room for a quick night's rest. The hosts responded instantly! It was a very short Uber ride from the airport. The room was small but clean- good place to crash. Great value.
1178106,157381114,2017-06-03,90137680,James,"Stayed here for one night when taking connecting flights from Boston Logan airport. Perfect location for the airport, and only 2 stops by subway from central Boston. Apartment was clean and as described. Would happily stay here again."
1178106,158619847,2017-06-07,72595965,Naomi,The room was great and really close to the airport which worked for me. 
1178106,159726631,2017-06-11,125561911,Scott,Good enough if you're just looking for a place to lay your head. Pretty hot in the room could've used a fan/ac. Overall it was fine!
1178106,160321217,2017-06-13,42077044,Murat,Great place to stay in Boston if you have a day or two before your next flight. Very close public transportation and Logan airport. Izzy was also very accommodating with early and late check-in/check-out requests. Thank you for hosting me!
1178106,160548218,2017-06-14,36004302,Mandisa,Place was perfect. Easy access to train and very close to the airport
1178106,161056214,2017-06-16,6645619,Andrew,"Just what I needed! A reasonably-priced place close to Logan. Room was clean and tidy, bed was comfortable, no noise, internet was fast and reliable, air conditioner kept me comfortable."

1178106,163398161,2017-06-24,103620207,Evalizbeth,Had a good time. Laid back and chill place. Room was a little smaller than how it seemed in the picture but overall it was great. The host was also very nice and helpful. 
1178106,163908093,2017-06-25,132803212,Oscar,Very good opportunity!
1178106,164779136,2017-06-29,86969508,Lila,We absolutely loved our stay! The home is very close to public transit and you can go anywhere from there. We loved meeting people from all around the world ! Lina was wonderful! 
1178106,165035641,2017-06-30,66916622,Kristopher,The room is great.  It is very basic but right by the airport.  If you are needing a quick night by the airport it is the ideal set up.
1178106,167129712,2017-07-05,44455154,Christopher,Nice place to stay! It was great having the room prepped for me to stay easily overnight and check-in and check-out was super smooth and made the travel a breeze. 
1178106,168519821,2017-07-09,34686792,Justin,"Great location next to Logan airport. Easy in, easy out. "
1178106,170107353,2017-07-14,58799948,Lisa,"The room is comfortable, but very small as previous reviewers have said. That being said, Izzy and Lina were gracious hosts and did everything possible to make my stay comfortable. The location is fairly convenient to both the airport and downtown area. I would stay here again, but probably only for a one-night layover and not an extended stay."
1178106,170453761,2017-07-15,129656700,Diego,"very friendly people, the place is really close to the city center ($12bucks in a lyft ride). Room is a little small, but perfect for spending the night "
1178106,171054363,2017-07-16,107452270,Phytotec SAS,It is second time I am in his house ! It's the best option in Boston! 
1178106,172043659,2017-07-19,119732080,Peter,"Excellently located for a transit traveller. The hosts give a personal touch to ones trip, and are very well organised. "
1178106,172673513,2017-07-21,140315270,Joel,Super easy check in. Very close to the airport.
1178106,173057174,2017-07-22,15514080,Alexander,"Izzy and Lina's place is set up quite well for people coming from or soon going to Boston Logan Airport. It is clean, comfortable, and the mechanics of self-check in and self-check out run very smoothly. It is easy to get into downtown Boston as well. I did not meet Izzy or Lina myself, but they communicated through Airbnb quickly and gave thorough replies to my questions."
1178106,181935800,2017-08-13,6290018,Catherine,Great stay.
1178106,183211348,2017-08-16,19135978,Wonpyo,Good
1178106,187783444,2017-08-27,147579250,Gwendolyn,Cleaner and in much better shape than other share houses I've stayed in through airbnb. Only down side is the single bathroom for the 4 rental rooms. We were waiting a while to shower and left later than we expected.
1178106,191228885,2017-09-06,149092070,Bri,This was just what I needed - a place to sleep and shower on a long layover. The self check-in was perfect because my flight arrived after midnight. They let my leave my bags after check out so that I could grab lunch and see a bit of the city. Clean house and hosts were prompt with responses
1178106,191459014,2017-09-07,139863520,Carl,I was stuck in a storm and never made it to my accommodations so I couldn't rate the stay.
1178106,191740440,2017-09-08,118354554,Adam,Great all around
1178106,192052705,2017-09-09,56785128,Angela,"Great location. Near the airport. However, air could be better."
1178106,192529677,2017-09-10,45701557,Jack,Great location and clean apartment. Recommended.
1178106,193214566,2017-09-12,145806709,Vivekh,"Great place, definitely will recommend, really easy check in and check out."
1178106,193461830,2017-09-13,87492493,Brandon,"A good place if you need to lay your head down due to a long layover. Room is very small, which is fine if you are only spending a few hours there. If you are spending longer than one night, I would choose a different location."
1178106,193722783,2017-09-14,32872190,Gabriela,Everything was clear and straightforward!
1178106,195518941,2017-09-19,150746058,Nazire,"This is a great place for transit travelers. I flew in from Turkey to Boston and my train was leaving a day after for upstate New York, and I needed a place to crash until my train departure. 

This place is near airport, took my cab driver about 5 minutes. I would have walked if I didn't have two heavy luggages to lug around with me. 

Check in directions were clear. I had no problem gaining access to the house. The living room, kitchen and bathroom were clean. 

I only thought the room was a bit smaller than I imagined in the picture. It was a tight fit in the room with two luggages. My room key was missing and the issue couldn't be sorted until I left. It still wasn't found when I left the house. There were towels on the bed, which I didn't use, because I had my own. 
But the pillow cases and bedsheets looked neat, but smelled unchanged. I would at least bring my own pillow cases. 

Everyone was respectful and out of each other's way."
177129,485296,2011-08-29,970440,Catherine,"We spent 3 nights at Susan's place and spent a wonderful time !  The house is beautiful, warm and cosy. Susan is very welcoming and you can tell that she loves greating people in her place. She have a beautiful personnality and cook the best home breakfast I've never had ! 

I highly recommend this place for anyone. 

Thanks Susan."
177129,507306,2011-09-06,975098,Ben,"Susan will go above and beyond to accommodate her guests. The breakfast was exquisite, the room was clean and comfortable, and she exceeded all expectations as a gracious and welcoming host . I enjoyed my stay and know that I was very fortunate to have been a guest. Hospitality at this level is hard to beat. It is my pleasure to recommend Susan."
177129,514337,2011-09-08,911049,Guillaume,"We stayed for 2 nights in Melville Park.  Our staying at Susan's place made this short stay absolutely worthwhile.  She was quick to answer on a very short notice.  Her place is beautiful and very well located.  The T-Station (red line) is only a minute away and will drop you downtown in 15 minutes or less.  Susan is a wonderful host, was very helpful always wanting to offer the best stay possible.  When it is said that the breakfast is included... well it couldn't be more:  we had pancakes, fresh fruits, pastries (homemade!!!)  If you wish to stay for a while... be prepared to gain a few pounds.

Totally recommend it!"
177129,543484,2011-09-18,1120301,Adam & Katie,"Susan was a fantastic host. She was very courteous and respectful of our privacy. Her breakfasts and baked treats were always delicious. Her home was lovely, and she encouraged us to let her know if there was ever anything additional we needed.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her home!"
177129,557641,2011-09-22,370089,Hoy,"Susan was incredibly accommodating. She was kind, welcoming, and very responsive in communicating prior to our arrival. Susan went out of her way to be sure we enjoyed our stay in comfort and convenience. I would highly recommend her to anyone traveling to Boston area. "
177129,569656,2011-09-26,1015468,Yusuf,"Susan's experience in the catering and etiquette industry were reflected in our interactions with her.
My fiance and I were in Boston for 2 nights and 3 days
From the get go she was very helpful with directions from the airport to her place
The neighborhood is historic and beautiful, and it was very easy to get to Susan's from both downtown and the airport
She was a very gracious host, welcomed us into her home with open arms, but was very respectful of our privacy.
Susan includes breakfast, and when I say breakfast she went all out to prepare an amazing spread (be sure to try her home made blueberry pancakes and home made granola cereal)
All in all we are planning on another trip to Boston and would not only recommend Susan as a host, but would stay there again"
177129,601052,2011-10-05,322,Tinna,"Susan is a gracious host with a lovely home, and I highly recommend her B&B if you are visiting the Boston area. It is conveniently located near the T, which takes around 15 minutes to get downtown. She goes above and beyond to ensure that her guests are comfortable. We also enjoyed our conversations with Susan over homemade breakfasts every morning and late night tea."
177129,627709,2011-10-14,1040417,Amanda,"We had a wonderful stay with Susan at Melville Park!  She has a beautiful house, yard & neighborhood but the best part is the atmosphere inside the house.  She truly treats everyone like honored guests and it felt like a privilege to stay with her.  AND the cherry on top is the amazing food she bakes and shares!"
177129,630720,2011-10-16,1016324,Rhian,"Lovely house and host, Susan goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. I would recommend to anyone, but make sure you arrive hungry!"
177129,641767,2011-10-18,1130356,Ken,"Our experience at Susan's beautiful home was fantastic. The location was very convienient to the metro (about 3 minutes easy walk) and the homes in the area wonderful. Susan is a terrific hostess - she even picked us up at the station the first night since our plane got there really late and then gave us a ride to a restaurant! The room and bed were very comforable. We had full  breakfasts served everyday and each time it was something different, and the snacks were out of this world!!! It's a shared bath situation, but we did not mind. We would recommend staying at Susan's to all our friends."
177129,645923,2011-10-19,1187771,Vince,"Everything you ever needed to know about good hospitality you can learn from Susan.  What a treat.  And, the apple crisp, fresh pumpkin bread, heated maple syrup and hot-off-the-griddle waffles... well, you get the idea."
177129,658979,2011-10-24,1231149,Angi,"My daughter and I stayed with Susan for a weekend in Boston.  This was our first trip through Airbnb, so we were not sure what to expect.  That said, our experience far exceeded any thoughts we may have had.  Susan started out by asking questions of us by email in order to make our stay more comfortable!  That was just the beginning of the many ways that Susan made us feel pampered!  

Susan is a naturally born hostess!  It is evident that she loves to create a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for her guests.  She made us feel right at home from the moment we stepped through the door....except nobody at ""home' spoils us the way she did!  Her home is beautiful and the location is perfect...just a very quick walk to the T on the Red Line, in a neighborhood we felt very comfortable in.

Besides all that, she loves to cook!  So if you go stay with Susan, and you definitely should, make sure you're not on a diet!  My daughter and I would definitely reccomend Susan's place!  We hope to stay there again sometime!   Thanks so much for a wonderful weekend, Susan!
"
177129,695055,2011-11-06,1095758,Laura,"I recently stayed with Susan for 2 weeks on a business and pleasure trip to Boston. All throughout my stay, Susan was the ultimate host; always ensuring I was comfortable, had everything I needed, was well fed (she is an amazing cook!!!!) and had my privacy whenever I wanted it.
At Susan's you get the service of a 5 star hotel with a personal touch. Just a couple of examples: 
1. I get very cold at night, so Susan provided me with 2 comforters, 2 warm blankets, and a neat trick on how to warm up your bed using a hair blow dryer!!!
2. I cannot have white flour, Susan looked up flourless and wheat flour recipes to make me desserts and breakfast everyday.
And there are many more examples of how she tries to accommodate your needs and make you feel at home.

Thank you Susan for a wonderful stay! Hope to see you again."
177129,722418,2011-11-15,1358188,Diane,"Susan's home is super easy to get to from Logan and a very quick ride on the Red Line to wherever you want to go.  The bed was comfy and she had a cozy fire for us in the evening while we ate a scrumptious homemade chocolate cake.

Susan is a wonderfully gracious hostess who is easy to talk to and always makes you feel loved and cared for.  We very much enjoyed our Boston stay, and it had a lot to do with Susan's hospitality."
177129,869607,2012-01-17,588514,Andrés,"Susan was a wonderful host!
My friend and I had to book a place at the last minute, so I had narrowed my search down to her place and two others. The more we looked at the pictures, the more my friend and I felt “at home.” Susan was quick to respond to my many questions, which helped put my mind at ease! Susan was always a phone call or text away. Upon arriving to her place, it was just as described! She made us breakfast each morning, which was very impressive! It felt really good to sit down and eat breakfast rather than to just “eat on the go.”
Her place is very close to the subway station, and since my friend and I didn’t rent a car while we were there, this helped out tremendously!

If you are “on the fence” about which place to stay at while you are in Boston, I would highly recommend Susan! 
"
177129,1009921,2012-03-17,1760983,Alex,"Susan went above and beyond what I was expecting. Her hospitality and her generosity was unlike anything I have experienced. We had our prior reservation cancel on us and so we found Susan when she contacted us on the standby list... She picked us up for south station and made us feel so welcome it was the best way we could have started our trip. All the reviews below are true. If you're looking for a place to stay we highly recommend Susan, not just for the banana/cranberry/ pumpkin bread but also for the convenience when heading into central Boston."
177129,1021798,2012-03-19,1922443,Matthew,"Everything about my stay with Susan was phenomenal! She is a genuine sweetheart; receptive, respective and accommodating. Her house is charming and immaculate. She treated myself and my significant other to truly gourmet breakfasts and snacks! The red line metro is only a few minutes walk away. "
177129,1095194,2012-04-07,1119425,Joseph,"Susan was a phenomenal host.  The house was clean and comfortable and she went out of her way to make my stay a good one.  

I would definitely go back and stay with Susan again. "
177129,1109911,2012-04-11,1957284,Brian,"On my way to Susan's place, Susan was running a little late and she called me to let me know and to apologize. My girlfriend and I simply waited on the patio in her backyard for 10-15 minutes for Susan's arrival. It was not an ideal situation, but Susan made it clear that it was her priority to be there when we arrived - and after staying 3 nights in her place, I truly believe it was. Some things just happen.

As for the actual stay, my girlfriend and I could not have been happier with Susan and her hospitality. From the moment we were there, it felt like a home away from home. Her wholehearted approach to satisfying the needs of her guests is evident from the moment we met her. 

Her politeness and professionalism is only matched by her cooking and thoughtfulness. Before visiting Susan, I read several reviews about her cooking, but nothing is like the real thing. I will just say this: come with an empty stomach! Her breakfast and evening snacks will impress you. Towards the end of our stay, my girlfriend mentioned to Susan how much she liked a certain tea that Susan had, so what did Susan do? She gave my girlfriend a 1/2 bag of her tea leaves! How awesome is that? 

We spent much time just sitting down and conversing with her about Boston and about life. She was incredibly down to earth. She provided insights into the city and her neighborhood that aided us immensely during our stay in Beantown. 

I have stayed in several bed & breakfasts, and this ranks up there with the best of them. From the quality of the bed and linens, cleanliness of the bathroom, deliciousness of the food, and the awesomeness of the host - all combined to make this a 5-star BnB experience. 

If you're thinking about choosing Susan and her BnB, stop thinking. Book it. You won't regret it. "
177129,1146742,2012-04-18,1316516,Carsten,"My wife and I have spent four wonderful days with Susan. The house is very pretty and our room was perfect. Our hostess Susan received us very warm received and we have felt comfortable with her. The highlight is the breakfast. We already were a few times in the USA and it is the best breakfast which we ever have had. 
You must absolutly try the Granola! ;-))
We can recommend this accommodation without restrctions and thanking Susan for her hospitality. 

Best wishes,
Andrea & Carsten, Germany"
177129,1165436,2012-04-22,579044,Pam,This review is long overdue!  We stayed at Susan's place on a last minute request for an accomodation in Boston.  Not only did Sussn accommodate our request bUt she far surpassed our expectations.  she truly is a gratious host with an incredible talent for making scrumptious breakfasts.  We highly recommend a stay at Susan's!!! I know I will:) 
177129,1259487,2012-05-10,1980750,Soledad,"We stayed at Susan's for four nights and really enjoyed it. The location is very convenient as it is close to a red line tube station which takes to to Boston center. The house is clean, the bedroom spacious and Susan will try to accommodate to your needs as much as her busy schedule allows.  Her breakfast is super (so are her home made sweets, which she shares generously), so make sure not to miss it. For southern european standards, breakfast time ends rather early, but it is certainly worth it. We have already recommended Susan's place to friends who will be in Boston this week, and we will go back to hers if we have the luck enough to be able to visit the city again."
177129,1295865,2012-05-17,2251246,Cathy,"Susan was a wonderful host and breakfast was delicious.   She lives in a lovely area and we loved hearing the birds each morning.

Our only regret is that we had plans every evening and were unable to taste her highly rated cake.  We hope to visit again and give it a try!  :)"
177129,1335465,2012-05-23,2148116,Naomi,This B&B is in a wonderful location to visit Boston and the surrounding areas.  The subway stop is only a short walk away.  Susan is great hostess.  We enjoyed the wonderful breakfasts and treats she prepared and the time we spent visiting with her.
177129,1373921,2012-05-29,2229122,Mascha,We loved our stay at historic Melville. Susan was a great host. She was very forthcoming with information about Boston and spoilt us with a great breakfast and afternoon treat. We would definitely recommend staying at this lovely place.
177129,1402650,2012-06-02,588412,Shawn,"My experience was wonderful!  Susan's home is beautiful and only 1 block from the MBTA Red Line, so it was extremely convenient for my daily commute to Cambridge.

Susan provided wonderful advice while I was searching for an apartment -- advice which eventually lead to my summer apartment.  Susan did everything in her power to ensure that Darwin, my dog, and I had a comfortable stay with her.

Ps. Don't forget to try her famous granola.  It's famous for a reason!"
177129,1891819,2012-08-05,2234643,Alessandro,"I love everything about this place. The house is historical and in a quiet, conveniently-located neighborhood. Susan was incredibly warm and welcoming, and she clearly knows how to be a perfect host. The cookies and breakfasts she made for me were absolutely over the top; she even drove me to South Station when I left, although she didn't have to, but apparently she goes to great lengths to make sure that every guest has a perfect experience. I would warmly recommend this place (and host!) to everyone."
177129,2176978,2012-09-03,2572051,Andreia,"I spent four weeks at Susan's place and I had a great time. It was my first time in Boston and she helped me a lot. She is an amazing cook. So, the breakfast is delicious. The house is beautiful, clean and located very close to the red line T. I strongly recommend this place. Thanks Susan!"
177129,2271120,2012-09-12,2756066,Rachel,"It was our first airbnb expirience and we were pleasantly surprised. We were welcomed as strangers and left as friends. Once you find the path to her heart you will discover a warm caring hostess. If you are there on a weekend expect a chef's breakfast, a real treat."
177129,2369117,2012-09-22,3021079,Gwyne,"This B & B is very convenient to the red line--only about 2 blocks, so we were able to enjoy Boston with the 7 day subway pass.  We were only there on weekdays, but even so Susan prepared lovely fruit plates for us and baked personal coffee cakes several of the days.  Susan's home is very clean."
177129,2457201,2012-09-30,1232653,Mathias,"We did have a great time in Boston. Susan was a very accommodating host: She is courteous, friendly and told us a lot about Boston and its surroundings -- as professional and well organized as a hotel manager, but far more personal. She even prepared a delicious dessert for us one day and breakfast was always healthy and tasty. 

The room was simple, but well equipped with a bed, a small desk and a hanger for the clothes. We slept very well. Even if the house is located in a residential area quite far from downtown Boston, it is easy to get there using the metro. It is worth to take these extra miles -- because of the price and of course: because of Susan, the queen of charm."
177129,2569982,2012-10-10,2088332,Sabrina,"Susan was a wonderful host, and in addition she is a fantastic cook baker (my personal favourite was the apple tarte). Her house is very clean and located just one block away from the red MBTA line. I would definitely recommend to stay at Susan's comfort B&B."
177129,2584429,2012-10-11,1934376,Imogen,"Susan is a gracious and welcoming host who puts considerable effort into making sure everything is set up well for her guests, including offering breakfast during the week, cooking an incredible breakfast on weekends, and setting clear house rules so everyone knows what's what. And if you're lucky, you might get a freshly baked treat and an interesting chat over a cup of tea. The historic house is lovely, clean and comfortable, and right near the subway heading straight downtown. The room I had was very comfortable and quiet, with lovely furnishings and excellent wifi. I found Susan's house such a good option that I extended my stay and then came back when I returned to Boston."
177129,2610938,2012-10-15,2234636,Tess,"We absolutely loved our stay at Susan's place. Susan is warm and welcoming, great to talk to and makes a fantastic breakfast, we loved the freshly baked pumpkin loaf in the morning YUM. The bed was comfy, the bathroom and house spotless, and the neighborhood is beautiful. Really short walk to the red line train which gets you straight to the middle of Boston or harvard. Would definitely recommend."
177129,2767935,2012-10-30,3976379,Ijeoma,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
177129,2881365,2012-11-13,3818916,Rankin,"Had a great time in Boston! Susan was super helpful, and very accommodating. She runs a very friendly, clean BnB in a nice area with easy access to the RedLine subway to get you anywhere you want to go in Boston. Thanks Susan!"
177129,3776478,2013-03-13,333491,Amber,"Susan was such a gracious hostess!  Her baking is divine (seriously, and I'm a trained chef!) and the room was equipped with everything I needed to be comfortable and feel at home.  

The charming house is very, very close to the T station, and getting to the city is a short hop.  I didn't venture out in the area surrounding the house so can't speak to the neighborhood, but if travelling to the area to visit the city, this is the PERFECT location, and perfect hostess.

Thanks so much for  your hospitality, Susan, and I can't wait to try your new granola line (BEST GRANOLA I've EVER had!)

--Amber"
177129,4025454,2013-04-03,105051,Barbara,"To better appreciate Susan's hospitality, I need to briefly describe the situation during which I came across her BnB. My family had planned to come from Europe around the birth of my first child. I was looking for a clean, safe and well connected place by public transport and Susan's place fit all the needs. Susan took wonderful, almost personal care of my family making them feeling home. She went as far as sending me tarts and flowers while we were all waiting for the baby. I definitely recommend her , and will for sure send family/friends to stay with her again!"
177129,5247722,2013-06-20,6609521,Jon,"We had a great time staying with Susan.  She was extremely friendly and professional, and really went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable.  The accommodations were clean, cozy and very well-maintained.  Highly recommended!"
177129,6363003,2013-08-10,5869739,Annie,"I've been in Boston and Cambridge for almost two months as I was studying at Harvard for the summer and I still had things to visit and discover when I left ! 

The B&B is located in a calm residential area, 2 minutes away from a subway station leading to downtown Boston in about 20 minutes and in Cambridge and Harvard in approximately 40 minutes. The house is lovely, as is the hostess. The breakfasts she prepares are the best way to start a good day of tourism or to gain energy to study. Susan always has places and itineraries to propose you to help you make the most of Boston. If you have questions about anything, feel free to ask her.

My room was well furnished and the house is clean. I felt very conformable and welcomed and I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this B&B again.

Thank you for everything Susan !"
177129,6547435,2013-08-16,7899832,Maria,"Susan was a great host. We enjoyed our stay immensely.  The house is beautiful, comfortable and private. Close to trains into boston. The breakfast is great as well."
177129,6720858,2013-08-22,7118322,Eric,"I stayed 5 nights in Susan's B&B and felt like home, with my privacy, in my very comfortable top floor large room. Susan was very concerned about my trip and gave me nice suggestions for places to visit. The metro is a short walk far and it takes you in the city in less than 20 minutes, operating till 12:30 pm."
177129,6846706,2013-08-27,2344896,Marielle,"We had a wonderful time at Susan's. The house was a neatly-kept, charming haven situated just a block away from the T Red line station. Susan took great care of us and prepared us delicious breakfasts.
In other words, très bonne adresse et super rencontre!
Merci Susan,

Fabrice, Jeanne, Camille et Marielle."
177129,8576464,2013-11-05,3694854,Jean,"Susan's house was a real find and Susan was a great hostess. The house is a charming single family Victorian home in the historic district and only 3 minutes from the Red Line on the ""T"". On the weekend there is on-street free parking. Susan was great to talk to and a wealth of good advice about getting around town. The breakfasts were gorgeous and delicious. I only wish I had more time to stay and savor them."
177129,9849023,2014-01-14,9620120,Katrina,"I stayed here with a few other friends for a wedding that was in a house around the corner, so needless to say, the location was a huge convenience for us. It's a charming home, the rooms are plenty spacious and well furnished, and Susan is a wonderful hostess. She gave a thorough tour of the house when we first arrived, consistently made sure we were comfortable, and as others have mentioned, really outdid herself with Sunday morning breakfast. This is a great place for anyone who wants to experience what it's really like to live in Boston."
177129,10842424,2014-03-10,3373283,Tonya,"Susan is a wonderful host. Her house is charming and beautiful and she serves great breakfasts. Our favourite was the Sunday brunch of fresh fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs and bacon. She gave great advice about where to go when we were in town, telling us which touristy restaurants to avoid and which ones we definitely had to experience. The bedroom was spacious, with four windows -- just as depicted in the pictures. "
177129,10933638,2014-03-13,5235973,Naomi,"My stay was perfect.  Susan is a generous and accommodating host.  Her communications prior and after booking were always prompt, clear and helpful. This was particularly notable as I found myself making a reservation last minute on a weekend around a complicated work travel schedule. Susan graciously offered me best times to communicate with her, allowed a late check in and after arrival was invaluable in helping me sort out how to get to my various meetings efficiently.  This was further enhanced by the convenience of her location, fast efficient public transport into the heart of Boston is literally around the corner. Access to the highways for travel to my meetings outside of Boston was also easy by car. The room was simple but comfortable.  The entire space is very clean (note shoes off policy bring your slippers), comfortable, quiet and private.  The ability to come and go and be pretty much left to my own devices was of great value to me.  As it turned out I found Susan so interesting and engaging I’m afraid I ended up seeking out her company more then was fair.  She also provided the most delicious baked cranberry bread and fruit salad at breakfast – which she kindly sent me home with for the long drive the last day.  I would also recommend trying to plan a 10-15 minute walk up and down Melville Ave and some of the side streets to gawk at the beautiful Victorians – really a spectacular collection of Victorian homes."
177129,12018714,2014-04-21,13873598,Frank,"As our first Airbnd experience, we were a little apprehensive.   About 10 seconds after meeting Susan, the apprehension went out the window.  We had the most wonderful experience with Susan.   Her home is just like the pictures, nice.  And Susan's hospitality is phenomenal.  From suggesting great restaurants to eat prior to check in to a parting gift of her homemade granola, we found her to be very engaging and gracious host where our comfort was her main concern.  We were fortunate to stay til Sunday morning when Susan prepared a breakfast that was beyond all expectation!  Fresh homemade zucchini bread, fresh fruit, fresh homemade blueberry pancakes, eggs, potatoes, sausages.  Don't know how we ate it all, but we found a way!  Location had us concerned a bit, since we were new to Boston on a college tour trip.  Super convenient location, with the T stop so close, just a short walk.  We're now experts on the T.   We were concerned with safety on the walk to Susan's bnb, but it was not an issue, just a two block walk and neighborhood was quiet when we arrived back after dinner.    Suggest you give it a try!  Thanks Susan!      "
177129,12380801,2014-04-30,440858,Estela,"I stayed at Susan´s house during April 24th-29 this year and I was very happy to have decided to stay there. Susan is a wonderful host, a very interesting woman and has a beautiful house, everything exactly as on her description.  She was very kind to provide me all information I requested and was also available on the phone in case I need to call her.  Her house is beautiful, quiet and very charming. She is very respectul and cultivated, and I really regret i couldn´t spend more time there and had more time to chat with her.  The house is very clean and everything is very well organized. The rooms are big and very comfortable, and with all amenities.  A plus point is that it is very close to the Subway Station with a direct train to the city in 10 minutes. I highly recommend Susan as a host. "
177129,12516825,2014-05-04,13890575,Saleh,"Susan was very nice, welcoming and cheerable host. She made me feel very comfortable in her place. The place it'self was clean, tidy, and quiet. Towls, soap, shampoo are there for gusts. I liked the location as it's not far from downtown, about 10 mins driving meanwhile it wasn't noisy and the surrounding area not conjusted. I think for the price I paid/nt,  it's very good place to stay."
177129,15028686,2014-07-01,12757182,Aldis,"Susan made sure that my stay in Boston was a pleasant one.  She was very respectful,polite, courteous and helpful. "
177129,15411694,2014-07-08,16502440,Daniel,"This was the first stop on our 10-day East Coast journey, so it was a great way to start: considering I made these arrangements sort of last-minute, I'm really glad I found Susan on Airbnb. She was attentive to every detail, and everything was as advertised. I chose her place because my father grew up in Dorchester, and while this is certainly not my father's Dorchester any more, the neighborhood was safe--I never felt uneasy walking around the area. Susan was especially great to my 12-year old son--she even baked cookies for us!"
177129,15580108,2014-07-12,5405040,Isabelle,"We spent five days in Boston this past week and could not have asked for a more gracious host. The room and house were exactly as described and Susan made sure we had everything we need. The location of the subway and the free parking were an extra bonus! Thanks so much, Susan!!"
177129,15773858,2014-07-15,11965519,Sasha-Nicole,"This was a beautiful house to use as a base for exploring Boston. There was three of us staying and Susan provided an airbed for the third guest. She was extremely polite and helpful, suggested many activities for us to do and found every opportunity to treat us to her wonderful cooking and baking. On arrival, there were delicious warm brownies waiting for us (despite it being midnight when we arrived!!), she provided breakfast every morning, including a cooked breakfast on Sunday which we enjoyed so much. The house itself is spotless and a lovely place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Susan's etiquette and hospitality were always outstanding and we felt truly looked after. The location is great, just 2 minutes to the T subway stop and then 15 minutes straight into Boston. Thanks, we'd definitely stay again! "
177129,15870892,2014-07-17,16160390,Lizzy,"Susan是个很严谨的人,每天早晨都亲自烘烤蛋糕,房子也很干净,就是门的密封不是很好,我们居住的第二天,其他住客竟然把房间里的收音机开了一夜,不知为何严谨的房东对这样的住客不提出异议?房子所在的街区很安静,但房子离路边很近,晚上有车过的时候还是有点声音,离地铁红线车站很近,交通非常方便,里火车站只有大概五站路,波士顿的地铁很发达,住在Susan的房子中正好可以充分利用地铁线路。"
177129,16586028,2014-07-29,18356831,Emily,"Susan goes above and beyond the expectations of an Air BnB host. She gave us a true bed and breakfast experience - providing us with towels, bath robes, shampoo & conditioner, breakfast every morning (pancakes and bacon, banana bread, blueberry bread, fresh fruit), and an amazingly clean (beautiful victorian style) house. Susan is so sweet and full of advice on touring around Boston. I stayed with my boyfriend and neither of us felt judged for staying out late or staying together for that matter.  Oh and the train into the city is a block and a half away - but you wouldn't even know it looking at the beautiful neighborhood! P.S. she has a sweet (beautiful) puppy who likes to lick your feet and have her belly scratched - she's very obedient and playful! 
Also, Susan has more then one room for visitors - 3 total I believe. But it never felt crowded or awkward.
Susan is an excellent host!"
177129,16829268,2014-08-03,3098108,Niamh,"I stayed with Susan for five nights and found her to be a great host and very welcoming, and an excellent cook. 

Her house is in a handy location as it is only five minutes walk to the subway station. The room was spacious and we never had any issues with sharing the shared bathroom with other guests as Susan had made provision for a reservation system for shower/bath use etc.

All in all, this was a great way to see a Boston neighbourhood. "
177129,17068571,2014-08-06,378013,Cornelis,"I had a wonderful stay in Boston and Susan was an exceptional host. She made some wonderful restaurant recommendations and created an inviting atmosphere. If you decide to stay with Susan (which I definitely recommend), try to be there on a Sunday morning when Susan prepares a hot breakfast. Delicious! 

Yes, I highly recommend this spot which is only a block away from a red line stop and creates easy access to the rest of Boston. "
177129,17220081,2014-08-09,17527959,Robin,"We  had a great stay with Susan! Dorchester is a cute neighborhood  and very simple to get to from downtown. A three  minute walk to the metro station, safe with historic houses. Susan made us feel very welcome and gave us a thorough tour right away so we know  how everything worked and how to get what we needed. She was friendly and  professional, offering delicious breakfast, homemade  cookies, and advice  when asked  for sightseeing, transportation etc. Queen of Charm is the perfect description for this hostess!"
177129,17422738,2014-08-11,19627830,Nick,This a great find in a surprisingly wonderful neighborhood. Susan was incredibly accommodating on short notice and was a fantastic host from start to finish. Rules were clearly laid out and the breakfast provided was wonderful. I must specifically note the breakfast she made on Sunday was hearty and delicious. We had a wonderful time. 
177129,17792254,2014-08-17,10653199,Martin,Thank you Susan for all the perfect recommodations in Boston. It was a pleasure to meet you and I absolutely enjoyed the stay at your home! The warm and freah midnight cookies just were awesome! Thank you so much for everything! Best greetings from Vienna
177129,18166254,2014-08-23,15296490,Laury-Anne,"Susan is a great host. I really enjoyed my stay at her home. The location is perfect, in a residential neigbourhood at 20mn from Boston Common (the subway is at 2mn from the house - if you walk slowly). The room and bathroom are very clean. Susan is really nice and a great cook (you have to try her cake!!). I also appreciated our discussions. Thanks for all Susan."
177129,18888560,2014-09-02,4220772,Bruno,"Un très chaleureux accueil. J'ai beaucoup aimé tout ce que Susan a fait pour nous. Nous sommes arrivés très tard et elle a tout de même été très accueillante. Le déjeuner, spécialement celui du dimanche matin, était très bien. Susan nous a toujours fait sentir qu'elle était présente pour nous aider.

Le quartier est très sympathique. Le logement se trouve à cinq minutes de marche du métro. Nous avons laissé notre voiture stationnée dans la rue et tout s'est bien passé!"
177129,19055982,2014-09-05,20645651,Christopher,"I arrived late (after 8pm), Susan greeted me at the door, and gave me a tour of the house, we had a pleasant chat for a few minutes, and she explained the house rules, all were very straightforward and understandable.  

She provided information about breakfast, and the next morning I met the other two house guests and they were very nice.  Susan's house has the classic charm of a turn of the century New England home mixed with Modern day furnishings.

5/5 Was very pleased with my first experience here with AirBnB.  Would stay here again!"
177129,19131456,2014-09-07,4943314,Phil,"Susan and her very cute puppy welcomed us immediately and gave us a walk through tour of the home and ground rules.  It was the most thorough instruction I'd ever received, but was evident of her experience with AirBnB.  Everything was as described.  The location was almost perfect for our needs with easy access to the MBTA.  This is a busy neighborhood and at times there was loud traffic during the night something that is out of her control, but just a warning if you are needing a deep sleep.  It was delightful meeting her other guests and I can't imagine staying with a nicer person.  "
177129,19334198,2014-09-10,548758,Michael,"We greatly enjoyed our stay with Susan. Her home was lovingly restored and comfortable. Susan is a masterful cook, and great to talk to while her co-host, her puppy, Zoey, was fun to be around. Susan provided helpful information for sightseeing and getting around Boston. Not to missed is her Sunday breakfast. To accommodate the number of guests staying with her at any one time, she will provide structure and guidelines to assure the BNB runs smoothly. Thanks Susan!"
177129,19739785,2014-09-17,3010577,Colin,"Susan was the best hostess (hostess with the mostest) we have ever met.  I stayed with my friend and Susan sweetest and nicest person.  If we come back to Boston we will definitely stay with her....

Maiyan and Shahar"
177129,20156726,2014-09-24,3217535,Federica,"The room is very spacious and Susan's house is located in a very quiet area. Our bed was extremely confortable and we really liked the possibility to have in-house breakfast every morning.
Susan's home is very close to the subway. It's a five minutes walk away from the station if you are a slow walker. South Station is 20 minutes away so this accomodation is ideal if you want to go home to a quiet place yet want to be close to the city center.
Our stay at Susan's was only two day long but very pleasant."
177129,20267287,2014-09-26,21029845,Markus,"Susan is an amazing host, it doesn't get any better. She made us superdelicious cookies, provided us great breakfasts, and made us feel so welcome that we decided to come back to her beautiful house a second time on our trip through New England. We highly recommend this place to anyone. Thank you very much, Susan, we really enjoyed staying at your house and it's a great pleasure to have met you!"
177129,20554195,2014-10-01,16541299,David,we enjoyed our stay very much...the place was clean and comfortable and Susan made us feel most welcome with all the changes we made...and our Sunday breakfast was excellent. 
177129,21104263,2014-10-11,21806354,Nghoiwah,"Susan is a very nice host. She gave me a tour over her house to introduce every single part. Make you feel like staying in your own home. The house is clean, characters and quite. a nice place to stay in Boston. "
177129,21461919,2014-10-18,18541198,Ronald,It was fantastic to stay at Susan in Dorchester near to Boston. All was taken care for every day. Nice was the house the surrounding and short the way to the subway. We look back to a marvelous holliday thanks to Susan. 
177129,21608764,2014-10-20,21706065,Christian,Susan was just an awesome host and the room was as described. We also got a really good breakfast. All in all we enjoyed our stay and will come back once we are in Boston again.
177129,21971730,2014-10-27,22017359,Summer,"We had a lovely time in Boston.  The decription on the page was accurate.  Susan was quick to respond to any questions we had and helpful with directions and ideas.  The location to the public transportation was awesome and we were able to leave our car parked for most of our time in Boston.  She made amazing breakfast in the mornings and went out of her way to make things to each of our liking.  The beautiful house was quiet and the other guests were very respectful.  Susan gave a thorough walk through of the house and the expectations so that all guests were on the same page.

There is a friendly dog who greets you when you enter, so make sure you are a dog person.  Also, the house was full when we were there (8 of us), so the full bathroom with the shower did become congested in the mornings especially.  Susan has a system set up to help everyone get to the shower, although I still felt a little rushed."
177129,22261937,2014-11-02,22662099,Adélaïde,"Susan est une hôte très agréable et chaleureuse , qui nous a permis de découvrir Boston à travers ses conseils judicieux. Les chambres sont grandes et spacieuses et le petit-déjeuner très apprécié. La maison est située sur la ligne rouge, proche du centre ville (à 15min en métro)
Nous vous la recommandons vivement pour visiter Boston."
177129,22741000,2014-11-13,9994853,Jeanette,"I had a brief but pleasant stay at Susan's home.  She has a range of detailed rules and guidelines to help her run her busy home efficiently.  The continental-style breakfast with cereals and breads included a delicious homemade one each day I was there. Her homemade granola is quite tasty as well. In terms of sleep and quiet time, there was some helicopter and street noise at night due to it being an urban area.  It is close to the T which is a real plus.  (Transportation took longer than expected for me but it would depend on where you need to go and be. I was meeting friends from out of state who got lost for over an hour and we only had 30 minutes to visit instead of several hours. The T took 50 minutes  one way instead of 20-25  that day due to mechanical issues but I am told that doesn't happen often). Taxi prices were higher than I expected but I needed to transport luggage as well and found a combination of the T and taxi helped save money or to be safety-conscious if returning after dark. For those with light luggage, you may be able to manage just fine on the T during non-rush hours perhaps even to and from the airport. Susan has a busy schedule and life with her other business and activities as well but she did check in with me to inquire what my plans were for my stay and was available for questions too. She has a very sweet and high-energy young dog for those that like dogs (I do). Susan is certainly a lovely person who wants her guests to have a nice stay in her home and in the Boston area."
177129,22888764,2014-11-17,15728808,Massimiliano,"Susan is the perfect host: welcoming and always charming. She simply makes her home your home! Great historic house, comfy bedroom, and excellent shared spaces. Hot breakfast on Sunday is a treat! "
177129,23450982,2014-12-01,12704379,Miriam,"We had an incredible time at Susan´s place. Susan was very kind and hospitable and made sure we were comfortable while staying in her place, she was helpful with suggestions as well. "
177129,27884973,2015-03-14,25924698,Cheong,"I feel secure and comfortable staying at Susan's nice house. It is very convinent to travel around boston from her place, since it is very near to MBTA Shawmut station. The neighbourhood feels safe too.

This is my first time to Boston and country with snow. I feel very lucky and glad that I have friendly Susan to guide me.
"
177129,28036112,2015-03-16,11624772,Leonard,"I want to be just as well received as in Susan, where we were treated really as guests.
The house is very clean, nice, we feel quickly at home.
Susan is smiling, dynamic, caring, and gives you advice on your visits.
I really hope to come back here.
see you soon"
177129,28246149,2015-03-21,16121861,Saskia,"Wir waren 5 Nächte in Boston. Die Unterkunft von Susan war sehr sauber und gemütlich eingerichtet. In unserem Zimmer hatten wir alles, was wir brauchten. Es war ruhig und angenehm warm, sodass wir wirklich gut entspannen konnten, nach unseren langen Erkundungstouren durch Boston. Susan war eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin, die sich mit ganzem Herzen um uns gekümmert hat und uns somit einen unvergesslichen Aufenthalt beschert hat. Das Haus liegt nah an der T-Station (Red Line) sodass man sehr schnell in der Innenstadt von Boston aber auch in Cambridge sein kann."
177129,28964765,2015-04-01,45395,Loredana,"Wow! I have 3 words; homemade apple cake.
We spent 5 nights at Susan's home while exhibiting at a Boston trade show and we really needed good and relaxing sleep. Bedroom was comfy and very quiet arranged with flowers and chocolate. Multi choice breakfast with homemade granola or cake was from outer space. Zoe, the chocolate ball of fur, was very cute and affectionate and Susan was charming and very helpful with tons of caring suggestions. Even thought the train stop was only around the corner we wound up using the car for the drive into the city and took several different routes each time so we had a chance to see some spectacular views of old homes, beaches and neighborhoods. Time flew by fast leaving us with good memory."
177129,29254270,2015-04-06,25157554,Dominik,Susan welcomed us warm although it was late in the evening. She is very nice and lovely and we enjoyed the time very much. Susan has a very cute dog called Zoe. The rooms are clean. You will be in about 20 minutes in the centre of Boston if you take the metro. 
177129,29697744,2015-04-11,27017925,Niraj,"Susan is a wonderful host and she went over and way above my expectations in making me feel welcome. In fact, she made me feel like part of her family. The location of her place is literally two minutes from the T station and as such extremely convenient for commuting to any part of Boston. The room was large, comfortable, well-appointed and the entire house bore the signs of a very high level of cleanliness. I am sure I am missing out many wonderful things Susan did to make my stay pleasant, like asking me my breakfast habits, offering me tea at the end of the day....and the list goes on. She even carried my suitcase up the stairs to the third floor  where my room was knowing that I had to be careful with my back. Honestly, cannot wait till the the next opportunity to stay at hers. Thank You, Susan for the incredibly sweet experience!"
177129,29869656,2015-04-13,30194618,Tiana,"Susan was a superb host.  It is clear from the presentation of the home and her welcoming nature that she aims to provide a comfortable and hospitable environment. She is very knowledgeable about Boston, and can offer great recommendations for both dining and entertainment. Her breakfast selection is delicious and filling...if you like granola, you will appreciate (URL HIDDEN) homemade. She also has an adorable puppy, who brings a unique charm to the B&B. Lastly, Susan is a quick and astute problem-solver who will try her best to make your stay as comfortable as possible."
177129,30437547,2015-04-22,21880230,Clare,"I stayed in Susan's lovely home whilst I was in Boston to run the marathon. The house is very comfortable and clean and Susan really goes the extra mile to ensure you have everything you need. 
My room was a good size lots of space to move about. There was ample drawers and hanging for clothes. On my arrival there were chocolates and fresh flowers in my room which I thought was a lovely touch. There was even shower gels and body lotions available to use. 
Breakfast was delicious. There was lots of choice, and many homemade items. Including delicious granola and cranberry bread. Susan even made granola and cookies for me to take home :) 
Susan has a gorgeous dog called Zoe. She was really cute and friendly.  
The house is located just a few subway stations from the centre of Boston and the subway is very near the house. It was very easy to get into town and home again. 
Susan is a very informative host, I had never been to Boston before so this was very useful. She is also very easy to get along with and I felt at ease in her home. She was really lovely when I returned from running the marathon, and ran me a bath, with relaxing salts in and even made me tea. 
I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Susan again.  "
177129,30650819,2015-04-25,30866518,Marissa,"The description of Susan's home was mostly accurate.  However, there was not on premises parking.  We were instructed to park a block away on the street.  After the 30 minute indoctrination of rules upon arrival, we quickly saw that this home was lovely and immaculately clean!  You will probably never stay anywhere cleaner.  Also, even though Susan has as many rules as the military (my husband and I are both veterans), the rules are mostly common courtesy rules.  The bedroom was spacious and the breakfasts were very lovely.  She had fresh fruit for us and even her home made granola!  Susan is the type of person to pay attention to the smallest details that would make people happy.  For instance, she had fresh flowers and water in our room, and one night she baked us cookies.  She is a great conversationalist, and wants people to be happy and to enjoy them selves as well as Boston.
Bottom line: if you are clean and respectful, you will probably love Susan's home.  She is clean, respectful, and loving.  Her dog Zoe is a little doll too.  She is sweet and was great with our 1 year old daughter."
177129,31602485,2015-05-07,3715589,Timothy,"I booked Susan's place to attend an event at the nearby JFK Library. Susan will followed up with details on directions and a brief questionnaire to be clear on your needs, if any.  This was timely because I was booking a bit last minute and it reminded me to share some dietary preferences which she went out of her way to accomodate.  She is very helpful with area information and always a text away if you have a question.  There were flower and chocolates in the room and the place was spotless.  Most importantly, the bed was very comfortable and beds can sometimes be hit and miss with Airbnb.  Breakfast was excellent and she seemed always ready to customize or supplement with some other breakfast items on the spot if she was around.  She even packed fresh fruit and yoghurt and her homemade granola for my painfully early flight back to the west coast - much appreciated.   It was a great choice and I would recommend the place to anyone."
177129,32388552,2015-05-17,32164992,Philip,"Susan is a great host! Very welcoming. We didn't spend much time at the house as we were only in town a short time and had lots to do there. Her place is a charming, comfortable old new england house in a quiet neighbohood a very short walk away from the red line stop. Downtown and Cambridge are a short ride away. Overall a great deal in a nice area very convenient to all that Boston has to offer."
177129,32516140,2015-05-19,30361263,Laurie,"Susan is a wonderful host. She welcomed us into her home and explained to us how the bed and breakfast worked; keys, shared bathroom, common spaces, etc. The room was clean and comfortable. She provided a lovely breakfast in the morning and has a sweet and gracious personality. Bonus: Her dog is adorable!! We only stayed two nights and traveled around by car. Street parking was not a problem at all. Thank you, Susan!"
177129,32764071,2015-05-21,31513345,Ronald,"With great pleasure, we think back to our visit to the Airbnb from Susan. The kindness and hospitality we get was for us a very positive experience. Our room was more than fine, slept with 3 people and the shower facilities were very clean and with care. The location was just outside the center, the metro was perfectly located 300 meters away and took us directly to the center. The breakfast was very responsible with fresh fruit and delicious banana cake. In short, it is definitely a must and worth for a repeating stay in Boston, Susan ones again many thanks."
177129,33090634,2015-05-25,7261578,Alex,"This was by far one of the most comfortable and well-appointed airbnb spots that I have ever stayed in. Susan is an extremely attentive host. Everything was very clean and there was even a bathrobe in the bedroom.

As some of the other commenters have noted, there do seem to be a lot of house rules. I was in town on business and might have given up some of the higher end amenities in favor of a more relaxed atmosphere.

That minor thing aside, I would say that this is a great place if you are in town on vacation and are looking for something that approximates a traditional bed & breakfast. Susan seems to know a ton about Boston and seems very passionate about offering people a wonderful experience."
177129,33566362,2015-05-30,26831296,Anne-Marie,"Nous avons passé une excellente semaine à Boston grâce à l'accueil et au professionnalisme de Susan.  La maison est située dans un quartier calme et agréable, très bien desservi par les transports publics, à 20 mn de la South station et du quartier historique."
177129,33861046,2015-06-01,10783562,Steven,Susan was very helpful and welcoming and took the time to get me settled in. She gave great tips and noticed I needed coffee badly after a long day of work. The b&b is very near to the subway which takes you right into the center in just 15 minutes. The house is clean and comfortable.
177129,34527542,2015-06-09,29801060,Andreas,"So everything was great. Easy way to the city and no problems at all.
Would do it again."
177129,36546887,2015-06-29,6170588,Vicky,"Very comfortable, impeccably clean and relaxing room.  We truly enjoyed Susan's hospitality, sweet little dog Zoe, complete breakfast each morning and special blueberry pancakes on our last day.   Perfect location for our four days in town.  Recommend highly!"
177129,37691059,2015-07-09,19403050,Ellie,Susan was a very welcoming host and was very attentive. The breakfast each morning was delicious! Zoe the dog was much fun to be around too.
177129,38521213,2015-07-16,6571524,Samara,"Susan was a great host. 
The neighborhood was very safe and short distance to public transportation. 
The house super cozy. 
Susan made us breakfast. 
Definitely a great place. 
Thank you Susan!!"
177129,39179848,2015-07-21,767099,Akemy,"Susan was an excellent host; my fiancé and I enjoyed our stay and felt welcome in her home.  She greeted us when we arrived and showed us around her home. Initially I was skeptical about booking in a B-N-B with a shared restroom, however this was never an issue during our stay. I never had to wait to utilize the restroom and it was extremely clean. Her entire home is spotless and my room had ample space. Susan is very knowledgeable about the area and will make great suggestions for your visit. Communication with Susan was excellent, and she was only a text away if you had any questions while exploring Boston. The neighborhood is safe and the red-line train is a couple of blocks (very short walk) away. The proximity to the train was very convenient. Her breakfast was a perfect way to start my day with an assortment of fresh fruits, yogurt, homemade granola and breads, which were delicious. Susan even surprised us with chocolate covered strawberries when we arrived on one of the nights! Just one note, if you tend to be a light sleeper I would recommend staying in the rooms further from the front of the home in order to avoid any street noise. Overall we had a great stay."
177129,39979961,2015-07-27,6815019,Michael,"Susan was a wonderful host. Friendly, helpful and an exquisite attention to detail. Susan's home was comfortable, clean and very convenient to the red line.  I felt very welcome and would highly recommend her home. "
177129,41124142,2015-08-04,36407136,Hsia,"Though a few days have passed, I still remember Susan's smile, her hospitality, the strawberry covered with chocolate she has made specially for our family and her thoughtfulness of either moving the electric fan away in case we may knock on it or leaving the lovely Zoe with us when we mentioned we liked her but couldn't  see her when we came back. There is a lot to say.... The room is very clean, the house is only 3 minutes' walk to the subway, and Susan is so helpful. She is really a very very great host. Next time we will surely stay at her house. I"
177129,42016303,2015-08-10,15252284,Kirsty,"Susan was the perfect host! The listing was exactly as described - comfortable and seconds from T train into downtown Boston. We had a wonderful stay in your home Susan, thanks again for everything, including your helpful tips for things to do, and not forgetting breakfast every morning!"
177129,44465348,2015-08-26,40617224,Jenna,Susan was a wonderful and warm host! We were not able to see her during our stay due to her busy personal schedule and our busy vacation but our encounters were just great! She was very accommodating. 
177129,45397016,2015-09-02,11941943,Jeanne,"What a great place to stay!  Susan was warm and welcoming, and her top priority was the comfort of her guests."
177129,46016498,2015-09-07,10491747,Beatrice,Susan was a wonderful host. She made us feel at home and provided us with many tips on where to eat and what to visit. Our room and shared bathroom were very clean and the subway is a 3 min walk. The breakfast was delicious (home made coffee cake and fresh fruit!) we had an amazing stay!
177129,46760821,2015-09-13,11267405,Giorgio,"Susan was the perfect host, so warm and kind. I had a wonderful stay in her apartment: I felt really at home. She is wonderful and dedicate all efforts to fulfill all the guest's needs. The apartment is perfectly clean, very well located, just 3 min from the subway in a nice residential neighborhood. The room was spacious, clean and the bed very comfortable. I think it's definitely the best place where to stay visiting Boston, a wonderful city I had the chance to appreciate in deep thanks to the great tips Susan gave me: amazing hotspots, restaurants and coffee bars. "
177129,47951242,2015-09-22,22575223,Jeanette,"Thank you Susan.   We have appreciated the effort you went to to make us feel welcome.

We were well fed, and your granola, pumpkin and banana breads were to die for!

Our room and all facilities were clean and comfortable.   We loved the historic surroundings of your area and the convenience to the subway and quick access to downtown Biston was a bonus.

We thank you too for your patience in answering the many questions we fired at you both before our arrival and during our stay, with patience and at length.   An excellent hostess."
177129,48899648,2015-09-29,35037257,Maria,Susan was such a wonderful host. Her place was clean and comfortable. She was very welcoming and responsive to any need we might have had. The home was very close and convenient to the T. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Boston. 
177129,49632062,2015-10-05,42383340,Kyle,"We had a great time, Susan was a great host"
177129,50491111,2015-10-12,43859539,Veronica,"Our stay with Susan was absolutely amazing! She personalized our stay as much as she could. She even went out of her way to make iced coffee for me! She's an incredible host, very attentive. You can tell that she takes great care of her home and she asks that you do the same. Which is great because that makes for a pleasant stay for all of her guests. She's genuinely interested to know how you spent your day and what you think about Boston. She gives you advice about where to go/how to get there. Getting to/from downtown to her house is super easy. Public transportation as a whole is super easy. Her dog Zoe is super sweet and playful. We had the room on the third floor and it was so cozy! With a window on two sides of the room, we would open the curtains in the morning and the sunlight would flood in. Just gorgeous! Both my best friend and I highly recommend staying with Susan. Even if we don't go together, we will both try to stay with her on our next trip to Boston!"
177129,50973791,2015-10-16,40255151,Oleksandr,"Susan were welcome host and interesting collocutor. Home was nice and clean. Breakfast was home made and tasty. Dog is pretty. Location was good. But I feel, that the rules at home a bit strict. On the opposite, it allows me to trust to leave my things there and do not worry about my safety at all."
177129,51309985,2015-10-19,9252057,Joan,"We enjoyed our stay at Susan's immensely! Susan was there to greet and introduce us to her beautiful historic home in Dorchester. Her house is warm and inviting, and a comfortable retreat,--particularly after trapping around Boston all day. YES, Boston is a very easy commute away by car or subway (the ""T"")...although Dorchester itself has some very fine restaurants only a walk away (10-15 minutes) from Susan's house. We opted for Italian at Tavolo, and Vietnamese at Pho 2000--both great food places in the neighborhood. Susan was accessible to attend to our needs and questions (and makes excellent coffee cake and banana bread!), and made us feel very much at home in her home. We hope to stay with her again when we return to Boston."
177129,52650373,2015-10-31,11643104,Thomas,"We booked Susan's fancy room just a day earlier, and then booked the air ticket and rushed to the airport, didn't reply her questionnaire, but she went back home before our taxi arrived, gave us a warm welcome with her friendly dog - Zoe,  explained every thing about the house. The house is pretty clean and quiet, less than 5 minutes walk to subway, the red line took us to every where we want to visit in Boston. Our room is spacious, and our baby boy Mantou really love the room, the house,  Zoe and the Susan's homemade banana cakes. We really enjoy the stay in Susan's Victoria style house."
177129,65081928,2016-03-10,60834293,Yang,"susan is a elegant lady and zoe is a cute dog, we enjoying the short vacation in boston ~"
177129,65902810,2016-03-17,62013693,Toan,"She was very receiving. One of us got lost on the way and she helped direct us home. She takes her job as a host very seriously and makes sure that everything is spick and span around the house. She even took the time to prepare fruit and muffins for our breakfast. Susan was very clear about the house rules and hence there was no misunderstanding about what we could and could not do in the house. We were also given useful recommendations for different areas in the city. 
The rooms look the same as in the pictures, if not better! The neighborhood is quiet, and is very convenient because it is so close to the subway. Though it's not in the centre of Boston, if you don't mind a half-an-hour train ride every day, the location is ideal. "
177129,69499565,2016-04-11,59549690,Wendy,"We are in NYC now. We already miss you and Zoë and we miss our time with you in Boston. 5 days flew by! You are like a sister to me and you treated us like we were your own family. You took such great care of me and my 3-year-old daughter. You made us feel like we were at home.
We will never forget your great breakfasts with the nutritious fruit trays. You gave great travel recommendations and the perfect route to get there. us a recommended. 

Thanks for being so kind end playing with Celine. We were so surprised by the chocolate you put on the door when we got back home. After having trouble with uber  you helped us get a car and to sent us to south station. We loved the cakes you prepared for us to eat on the way to New York. I'll remember your kindness for ever. 

Don't forget we have a date next summer! We want to see you in Shanghai! 
We are very happy to have met you and stayed in your home. My friend we miss you !!"
177129,70039849,2016-04-15,32857972,Steven,"Susan was a very respectful and professional host. She welcomed us with tea and cookies and gave us tips on Boston. 
The house was pretty, full of character and as advertised. It is near public transport links within reasonable travelling distance to the city centre.
We enjoyed our stay here."
177129,70608736,2016-04-18,57792337,Diane,"Susan couldn't have been more gracious, warm, and accommodating.  I went to Boston with my 2 teenagers for a college visit, during marathon weekend no less!  Susan was so helpful with suggestions on what to do, how to get there, and took  a genuine interest in our lives while we were with her.  Her home is 3 minutes from the T stop and we had no trouble with public transformation.

We slept great, had AMAZING breakfasts, and just couldn't ask for more!"
177129,73260058,2016-05-07,23948502,Chenying,"Located in a sweet neighborhood, Susan's house is clean and well-maintained. 0.2 mile away from red line, Shawnut Station; Susan is an accommodating host; she welcomed us with hot tea, biscuits, and her cute dog, Zoey. She introduced a lot of rules and reminders that we should know when living there. She also sent me warm farewell texts:). As a reference for future residents, the following information might be helpful. 

1. Don't park your car at Allston St, as there is a 2-hour limit. Feel free to park at nearby streets. 
2. You need to share restroom with other guests in the house. (The restroom is clean. My mum ran into another guest when she used restroom at 3am in the morning.)
3. Kitchen is available for breakfast prepared by Susan. However, it is generally reserved for long-term guests, which means you need to dine outside for lunch and dinner, Just in case you want to cook, Susan must be present to get any needed equipment. Besides, guests are responsible for purchasing all the ingredients, including oil and spices. 
4. Air mattress: you pay a flat rate of $20. Let Susan know in advance and she will prepare it for you. The air mattress sounded noisy when I turned over at night. 
5. I saw Zoey play with my parents' shoes. While Susan stopped Zoey from doing so, I suggest Susan buy a shoe cabinet to make sure guests' shoes are clean and safe at the door. "
177129,74009903,2016-05-12,61550631,Jim,"Everything during our stay exceeded our expectations. Susan is a really good hostess. She took time to help us and made our trip to Boston really memorable. She not only answered our questions, she recommended places that we had not thought about. 
We really liked her lovely home, and felt totally comfortable and welcome there. It's in a really neat, historic area, and is only a few minutes from the T stop on the Red Line, which gave us easy access to all the best places in Boston.
Breakfast was a treat every morning, we loved everything, especially her granola. Her experience in the hospitality industry makes her a true professional. "
177129,76592579,2016-05-28,28238612,Erica,Wonderfully inviting.... Susan is a champion hostess.  We enjoyed our stay very much!
177129,80108446,2016-06-16,1984955,Steve,My son oscar stayed with Susan who was a very generous host. Oscar thoroughly enjoyed his stay and Provided much reassurance to a slightly anxious parent whose young son was far from home. Thanks again Susan and if you R ever in London we would love to host you. Steve
177129,82671655,2016-06-28,37741451,Jenny,"Susan is a meticulous host. She goes out of her way to ensure that her guests have the best possible experience, from clear and respectful guidelines to delicious and comprehensive breakfasts. Her home is very convenient, being so close to the Red train line into the city. The room was airy and spacious, very clean and comfortable. Having stayed at many Airbnb homes, this is one of the best."
177129,84047040,2016-07-05,31534653,Stacy,"Susan is a great host! Her house is really nice. If you are driving to Boston, this will be a really convenient place for you to park your car and take subway to the city. 
The only thing I had to adjust is that there's only one bathroom in the house, sometimes you need to wait for a little bit to take a shower. Other than that, I think this will be a great place to stay when you come to Boston.

177129,89985165,2016-07-30,14387406,Frederik,"I believe the pictures depicts the house wrongly. The rooms are very dark because the curtains and windows are closed at any time. Furthermore you are not allowed to go outside into the backyard and get some fresh air. That was really weird, when the host said that it was because the terrace was broken, but she used it herself. The bedrooms were fine and the breakfast was really nice with a lot of fruit. Susan helped us with barberque and that was so helpful of her. The main problem about this stay is that you dont feel like home at all. There is a lot of house rules, which is fine. But she turned very angry and kick the kitchen door when we took a piece of plastic for our food. That felt really unpleasant and you didn't want to be in the kitchen/dinning room. It was like walking in a mine field, you never knew when you were going to hit the mine. This is my very first try with AirBnB and way from succesfull. I believe that it is miss-guiding saying that the neighborhood is historic. It was nice that the metro was close, but you didn't want to go out at night in the area.   "
177129,90590890,2016-08-01,3147532,Peggy,Susan was there to greet us when we arrived. We travelled a long distance and she she kept in touch about our arrival time as we progressed. The house is immaculately clean. She made us feel immediately at home and like honored guests! She clearly communicated expectations and hopes for our stay. This will be our home away from home when we visit Boston again! 
177129,92410800,2016-08-08,87096089,Owlina,"Susan is a fantastic host, the perfect mix of formality and personal warmth! We adored her calm & peaceful ways and above all, her constant smiling face. She welcomed us with drinks & snacks on our arrival, which was absolutely unexpected. She was ALWAYS there making sure that every need was covered & provided us with plenty of tips and advice about the city & the neighbourhood. It was great to be experiencing a real part of the city rather than staying in an informal & impersonal hotel anywhere else. We especially loved our daily baked cakes & fresh fruit for breakfast, plus you couldn't really starve in terms of quantity. The room and the bathroom we shared with another guest were absolutely enough according to our needs.
I wouldn't recommend Susan's place to non-dog lovers as they might not enjoy the animal presence around the house, but we loved Zoe's company and the fact that she welcomed us every time we came back home & spent some time with us at breakfast time! She's such a cute and sweet little girl!"

177129,98064497,2016-08-29,80399746,Cassandra,"I loved staying at this place because it was very homey and warm. The house is beautiful and inviting. Every morning breakfast was prepared which was especially awesome being the foodie that I am. To top it off, Susan is a great host. She went out of her way to make sure things were going smoothly within the house and in regards to our Boston visit as well. She is so friendly and nice! If you don't know what to do in the area, she will surely give you plenty of ideas, and ways to get to your destination. Also, Zoe, her dog was an absolute pleasure!! I would definetely stay at this location again if I was in the area."
177129,99105412,2016-09-03,89944544,Rick,"Susan is a fantastic host, makes you feel right at home. Only complaint I could have is the boston traffic so prepare for the drive into the city to take 30-40min, all in all a great experience."
177129,99638584,2016-09-05,80799824,Alexandra,Great place. Susan is very helpful and professional! 
177129,138603058,2017-03-20,11934110,Stephanie,"Susan is the best host one can ever ask for. Her attention to every detail of your stay is just way more than what a traveler can dream of. Her house is kept absolutely tidy and clean and the breakfast provided was really delicious. Communication was always prompt and every need of ours taken care of. Susan's pet dog Zoe was also such a darling to us. We had a great time, thank you Susan. :) "
177129,142891766,2017-04-09,120582691,Rachel,"Susan is a great host. The house was comfortable and our stay was enjoyable. Easy to get to Boston, and a quiet neighborhood. "
177129,152284593,2017-05-15,126415544,Yi,"这是一个很不错的房子。距离地铁站仅有200米,进城和到其他地方都很方便。房子里面很干净、整洁,适合家庭或朋友入住。特别是它的主人susan小姐,非常热情,亲自下厨为我们做早餐,不明白的事情,她都会耐心给你解释,让你很满意。"
177129,154588765,2017-05-25,23885325,Yuqian,"Susan is the best host I have ever met in the U.S. through Airbnb, who is hospitable, friendly, considerate and generous. An ideal place to stay and explore Boston! My family felt very comfortable during the stay. Recommend it unreservedly!"
177129,163884449,2017-06-25,73066528,Sarah,Susan is a great host and her home is beautiful! It's a great neighborhood in close proximity to the t but still quiet and peaceful. 
177129,165656312,2017-07-01,102263287,Morag,"Susan was a great host, very welcoming and had so many helpful tips for our stay in Boston! She was always on hand and available but also gives guests their own space. Susan gave us a lovely breakfast each day, including home made banana loaf. The house was very clean and a really nice place to stay. The house is just a 3 minute walk to the T which makes it very convenient to get into the centre. We would stay again!"
177129,171445591,2017-07-17,134944104,Mikel,"Susan's place makes you feel like a local as soon as you get to the city. With the public subway system so close by (and easy to use), you can walk to anywhere or anything in Boston. Susan herself is most empathetic and patient host that I have EVER encountered while using BNB. She was very easy to communicate with and often times initiated conversations that helped us really enjoy Boston. Our Boston trip was enjoyable because of Susan. If i must say something that needs work I would put that the outdoor of the house could use some touch up and the neighborhood in which it is located is sometimes intimidating to walk through especially late at night. Other than that we are extremely pleased with our choice to stay with Susan."
177129,172032023,2017-07-19,140718771,Bill,Susan was an outstanding hostess and gave us great tips on navigating the city.  She is very welcoming and engaging.  We were celebrating our 30th anniversary and Susan had a nice  little gift bag with some Boston themed chocolates waiting for us when we returned.  Very nice touch and quite thoughtful.  The location was excellent with a subway station right around the corner.  
177129,174063856,2017-07-24,130261515,Catherine,"The house is well located nearby the public transportation. The bedroom was confortable. The breakfast was basic. Susan is a kind host. The only thing we had an issue with, she had 2 dogs."
177129,175001547,2017-07-27,48923320,Cat,"Susan is wonderful and kind, and her home is beautiful. When I arrived Susan gave me a lovely tour and even carried my suitcase upstairs. She provided breakfast (one of the days she made the most delicious coffee cake I've ever had), offered me an array of teas, refrigerator space, bathroom space, comfortable towels and every type of bowl, plate or utensil I could hope to use. She also left chocolates, water, cookies and slippers in the room for me. Susan is a caring host, I thoroughly enjoyed my conversations with her and found myself looking forward to returning to her home at night as the bed and space were so beautiful and comfortable. Susan's home is delightful and is conveniently located a three minute walk from the subway, has lots of extra umbrellas and very fast wifi. I would definitely stay with her again. Thanks for everything, Susan!"
177129,175757093,2017-07-29,141608620,Caroline,"Friendly host, clean and had everything we needed. Our bedroom even had a brand new and super comfortable mattress. "
177129,190621816,2017-09-04,139843770,Steve,"Susan takes a lot of pride in providing a top notch B&B. Her passion for hospitality shows in her commitment to her guest.

Susan's proximity to the Shawmut Station makes access to the city simple.

Best Banana Bread and Coffee Cake on the planet!"
8116523,46080158,2015-09-07,41902647,Matt,"Although I did not get to meet Frank in person, he was very quick to respond to my questions, very friendly, and did an amazing job making sure we had all the accommodations we needed. I did get a chance to meet Frank's brother and he was also incredibly kind and gave us some great recommendations for activities to do in the the city. 

The condo was very nice. It was in an amazing neighborhood on the bottom floor (partially underground, which was cool) of a very nice complex, it was quiet and extremely clean. Very convenient walk to Newbury Street, the Public Garden, Fenway Park, and  Downtown Boston. This place is very well priced for the neighborhood it is in and I would highly recommended staying here. Next time I am in Boston, I am definitely going to book with Frank. "
8116523,47522138,2015-09-20,23579653,Tucker,"Had an excellent stay here!  Apartment was clean and very spacious.  Location allowed for easy access to anything you need by way of foot, or Uber/train if venturing further.  Would absolutely recommend staying here, and will likely try and do so again myself in the future!"
8116523,48311380,2015-09-25,43119009,Stephanie,"Location was absolutely perfect! We walked everywhere in Boston - Cambridge, North End, Waterfront - you name it, we walked there.  Cozy little place with just enough space for 2 people - we were rarely there anyway with so much to see in Boston. I never saw Frank, but met his Brother & handyman - nice people and always great response when we needed it.  I definitely recommend! "
8116523,48911015,2015-09-29,26629277,LaNae,"For using airbnb for the first time, Frank made it so easy for us! He made sure we were well taken care off and had a quick response time to any questions we had! The location/size of his place was absolutely perfect and I would recommend staying there to everyone!

8116523,49057631,2015-09-30,31635092,Jessica,"Frank was very welcoming and responsive to questions.  It was a smooth process from reservation to checkout and I really liked the place.  The apartment is very conveniently located in a coveted, quiet neighborhood, as described.  I would definitely stay here again."
8116523,49247407,2015-10-02,43278961,Ben,"Apartment was in a good location, was clean and as described. Check in was painless as Frank provided a key code. Free WiFi and use of Amazon Prime was a bonus"
8116523,49831568,2015-10-06,12753162,Danlei,"Location is perfect. When I went there, one guy who was living 20 years ago in this building came to revisiting.  He stood in front of the building and told me his stories with deep emotions. Lovely. Frank is very helpful for answering questions to support so much. "
8116523,50007108,2015-10-08,44025565,Tim,"Very nice one bedroom garden apartment in a perfect Back Bay location.  Linens were top notch.  Easy check-in and out.  Would definatey book again.  Thank you, Frank!"
8116523,50490042,2015-10-12,21604533,John,"Exactly as described, with all the amenities one could need. Host was communicative and made access to the unit painless and simple. The unit was inviting and offered a great perspective of the city, with quick access to many sights and a great neighborhood."

8116523,51646989,2015-10-22,26351750,Christopher,The apartment was exactly as described in the listing with a great central location.  Frank made it a very easy and simple process and was extremely responsive and helpful.  Would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Boston and will be doing so the next time I visit.
8116523,52231208,2015-10-27,5199537,Genesa,"The flat is in a great location in Back Bay. Very easy to walk to shops abs dining and also the river. 

The flat is comfortable and stylish and a nice place to stay. 

We had one issue when we arrived that the second bed was not set up. Frank was responsive and able to get someone to come and set it up but it did take some time so I recommend you inform him before your arrival if you need to have a second bed in the unit for your stay. 

I would definitely stay again at this place. "
8116523,52360985,2015-10-28,46653672,Roy,Overall the neighborhood was nice and the description was very accurate. Definitely a nice place and would gladly stay there again.
8116523,53136547,2015-11-05,26083546,Michael,"Stayed one night in this great location! Safe place great walking distance from shops and the commons! 

Will be staying here again!"
8116523,53209797,2015-11-06,11871118,Matt,Frank made my trip extremely convenient by having the house instructions ready for me in a timely manner describing exactly how to get in the the house. Everything was as described. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and I had a perfect night's sleep. Very centrally located. 
8116523,53628157,2015-11-10,41107373,Tina,"The lodging at 189 Beacon Street was a great location for anyone wanting to tour the city on foot! It is the perfect location to stay in Boston and this little apartment was so cute. It offers everything you need to stay comfortably with a great full kitchen, living room, full bath and bedroom with a full size bed. There were a couple of things that had not been mentioned in any previous reviews that I will mention and may only be personal preference.

1. The apartment is the basement of the brownstone and at night when we were trying to sleep in the bedroom we could here people walking around upstairs until after 1am. In addition  we could also hear muffled conversations through the ceiling. (As far as any noise from the street that was very minimal and very tolerable).

2. The bedroom's bed linens were beautiful, but made from microfiber which can be very sweaty at night, but I think that's just personal preference.

3. The cot that is offered is not very comfortable to sleep on.

4. There was a slight sewer smell in the basement apartment.

Overall, I would probably stay again, but if there was another bedroom in this area at a lower rate I would stay there instead.

8116523,53715496,2015-11-11,47898443,Ellen,"This was an amazing experience.  The location was so close to everything but yet the neighborhood friendly & quiet.  Frank was really quick responding to any email and we felt very lucky to have found this place.  Also, the beds were really comfy & the apartment was well appointed and really decorated nicely. I  would definitely recommend this place!  Ellen"
8116523,54266156,2015-11-17,40441825,Andrea,"Staying at Frank's Brownstone in Back Bay was a great experience for my boyfriend and I. The town was so beautiful to look at and there was a lot of stores and things to do in the area. I highly recommend Frank's apartment over a hotel any day because it makes you feel at home and on vacation at the same time. The back bay common garage, where I parked my car, was only 12 minutes away by walking and I thought the rates were fair and cheaper than NYC. I hope to rent this apartment again in the future because a few days in Boston isn't enough time to see and do everything you want. Frank's apartment had clean linen and towels and had everything we needed. Overall I had a great stay and I'm sure Frank's future guests will also have a great experience as well."
8116523,54521554,2015-11-21,13831260,Uri,"The apartment is just as advertised. It is in a great neighborhood and was within walking distance to everything. 

Thanks again for a great stay! "
8116523,54866278,2015-11-25,20107175,Howard,"Frank was a great host. He has a nice place and it's in a great location and close to Newbury Street, restaurants and stores. It was very clean and had everything you need. The bedroom is small and the bed is comfortable but you can only get into it from one side unless you climb over. There was a damp smell I think from being part on the lower level but it was fine. Overall it's a great place to stay!"
8116523,54947995,2015-11-25,12614753,Sean,"Loved this apartment! It was bright, clean and spacious. Very close to so many shops, restaurants and bars. Would love to come back!"
8116523,55423304,2015-12-01,40069297,Erin,"We stayed here for over Thanksgiving break and just loved it. Franklin was extremely helpful and very communicative with any questions we had. This was our first experience with AirBnB and we will definitely use Franklin again when we are in Boston. The property was in a perfect location. Close to shops, eateries, and transportation.  Quiet sleeps at night and very safe location. "

8116523,56007005,2015-12-07,9738183,Nick,"Summary: nice host, great location, good quality furniture/decor/amenities, terrible smell

I stayed in Frank's place with 2 friends and we fit comfortably. One in the full bed, one on the twin cot, one on the couch. You could fit another in the bed if you're okay getting cozy.

It was very easy to get in and out. Frank gave us a code, which unlocked a box containing keys. He was very responsive with questions, and made an extra effort to help us when we lost a watch.

The street is a main avenue with high traffic but all residential housing. Sound at night was not an issue. Parking was somewhat difficult.

The apt is a basement unit. It has a separate entrance a few steps below the front entrance. Sunlight was fine. But the smell... The apt was dank and smelled like a sewer. The odor is noticeable as soon as you enter and Frank's scented sticks didn't totally cut it.

As I understood, the apt had access to a patio. It does not.

Would I return? Only if the smell was gone. Would I go to Frank if he had another place? Yes."
8116523,56535708,2015-12-14,7599865,Raegan,The apartment is very cozy and exactly as listed.  Frank helped me do a last minute extension when my plans changed and everything was easy from start to finish.  
8116523,57160485,2015-12-22,855723,Bridget,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed for a week, and we would not stay there again. The unit is EXTREMELY inaccurately represented in the listing. The listing describes a one-bedroom apartment with ""access to the entire unit, including bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, dining area, living room, and private patio."" The unit is actually the size of a studio. There is one main room that has a two-person couch, TV, and a kitchen area with bar stools next to the kitchen counter (there is no kitchen table). There are glass doors (not at all sound-proof) between this room and a ""bedroom"" that barely squeezes in a full-sized bed. There is no patio. The listing states there is a ""well-stocked chef's kitchen""- the kitchen is TINY and was not even equipped to cook the pasta and jar of sauce we brought with us, as the only pot in the entire kitchen could hold about 2 cups of water. The listing describes (in two places) a spare queen bed that can be set up in the living room upon request- my husband and I were planning to sleep on this as we had to work late and leave early several times (our daughter was going to sleep in the bedroom). Prior to our arrival, we specifically asked the owner, ""to set up the extra queen bed for us,"" and we were told this would happen. When we arrived, the bed had not been set up as promised. When someone finally came to do it for us on our second day, it turned out the spare bed is actually a TWIN bed, so my husband and I couldn't fit on it, ruining our sleeping plans. The ability to use the living room as our bedroom was part of the reason we chose the apartment in the first place. The owner told me that this part of the listing will be corrected, so hopefully that will happen soon. We would absolutely not have stayed here if we had a clearer picture of what to expect. "
8116523,58190567,2016-01-01,12734370,John,"The location was great.  The pictures were accurate.  The basement unit is small, but have everything one needs for 2-3 people.  The cleanliness was just ok.  The internet did not work and was an essential part of our stay, so, having given a day to resolve the problem, we had to vacate after the 1st night of a 5 night stay.  The Host refused to refund the unused nights, but Airbnb got involved and forced a refund.  If everything goes well during your stay, you will be fine. If not, good luck..."
8116523,58682718,2016-01-03,8992000,Addy,"Frank responded to all of our messages extremely quickly and was very patient when we were having problems with the Internet. He was a great, helpful host and the apartment is very nice. Great location."
8116523,60166417,2016-01-19,53967713,Elliot,"Overall great experience staying at Frank’s place for a weekend. The place was just as described and was a sweet little refuge from the cold weather and wet snow outside. Not to mention, great location! My girlfriend and I had a great stay. 

And if you have a severe anxiety issue with bed linen and towel cleanliness as I do, this place gets a big thumbs up!

Pro tip: Try the chocolate store around the corner for a saweeeet chocolate mocha"
8116523,60343421,2016-01-22,11468784,Carolyn,This listing was absolutely beautiful and my friend and I loved staying in this apartment. The directions and accommodations were very clearly described to us making it a breeze to enjoy. Would recommend this listing to anyone!
8116523,60903010,2016-01-29,28102337,Jon,"I thoroughly enjoyed my two-night stay at Frank's place. First the location is ideal being on a residential part of Beacon with a very short walk to excellent coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and points of interest. The apartment itself is very comfortable and has great charm precisely as described. Frank had fast and friendly communication throughout the process and could not have been better to deal with. Next time I find myself in Boston I'm definitely going to start my accommodation search with this listing... top notch!"
8116523,61183390,2016-02-01,24563793,Nancy,The place was great! The bed was super comfortable. An extra bed came in handy. You are close to everything! No complains at all. Would visit again! Thank you Frank!
8116523,61854043,2016-02-08,57171039,Tom,"Thank you Frank, The apartment was very nice, with lovely decor and a homely feel. The location is great, in a lovely neighbourhood just a short walk to the common and all the shop and restaurants around Newbury st.  Frank was very quick to respond and helpful with his emails. Next time I'm in Boston I will look here first. "
8116523,62905405,2016-02-18,17053356,Sherry,"The host Frank was extremely responsive and helpful to any of our questions and provided equally great accommodations for our 3 night stay in Boston.  Logistically speaking, it was convenient to just about everything.   The actual space was perfect for our needs and provided that comfy cozy home away from home feel hard to find in a hotel room.  Will definitely be returning again. "
8116523,63932956,2016-02-28,57436487,Monica,"The apartment was great and it was just as described, a bit small, but very cozy and comfortable. Location is also great in a very nice neighborhood and close to different restaurants, coffee places, shops and other points of interest. Frank is a great host and he made everything go very easy with the process and was also very responsive. Overall i enjoyed staying here and i would definitely recommend it."

8116523,64896530,2016-03-08,5971101,Grégory,The location is nice and quiet! A good place to enjoy the center of Boston easily!
8116523,65478235,2016-03-14,61400405,Nete,"Exceptional host! Awesome place! If you want a true, authentic Boston experience that is the home to stay. Right in Back Bay, beautiful brownstone building, tree lined street - doesnt get any more old Boston then that. Quiet, cozy and comfortable. This charming apartment is all those things. High ceilings, warm lighting, heavenly mattress. Perfect for catching up on sleep or a romantic getaway. Walk to Boston Common park or down Newbury street, take it a little further into South End or Beacon Hill. Everything is just minutes away.  Definitely reaching out to Frank when planning my next trip to the Bean."
8116523,65723725,2016-03-16,13680779,Barbara,"Beautiful, clean space. Fantastic area. Walking distance to lots of great restaurants!! We were so impressed we spent a couple minutes day dreaming and looking at similar apartments for sale in the neighborhood. 10/10"
8116523,65870229,2016-03-17,34528128,Veronika,Frank was a perfect and willing host. It was a pleasure to stay in his apartment. The communication was very fast. I can definitely recommend!
8116523,65890087,2016-03-17,53095119,Marisa,Frank was just a phone call away! The photos and description of the apartment are accurate and it's placement in the city is great for exploring. Beacon street is beautiful and very safe. Definitely a place to stay again if I'm the city on business.
8116523,66185813,2016-03-20,32196697,Heather,"We had a great experience at Frank's place. He went out of his way before our trip to provide recommendations for local dining/drinking and continued to check in with us to ensure we were settled and happy with the accommodations. The neighborhood couldn't be more beautiful. It was convenient to everything. The block is quiet and the unit is exactly as advertised. We found it to be very clean and comfortable and it contained everything we needed during our stay. We did run into a small snag with the wifi at one point, but this was quickly resolved by Frank. There is a wee bit of a smell being on the garden level, kind of a must, but it dissipates once you're in the unit and we only really noticed it when we first walked in after being out for a bit, so I don't consider it a major issue. This is a wonderful hideaway in Boston and I highly recommend it! If I ever go back, I'll definitely stay here again. It has all the modern conveniences you could want, while also have a very cool factor in terms of the space and neighborhood.  Also, there were three adults in our group and I slept on the blow up mattress, which was a very nice one (tall and with extra cushion) and the linens were perfect. Super cozy blankets for cuddling up and watching HBO on the big TV! Thanks so much, Frank!"
8116523,66798452,2016-03-24,25399512,Christina,"My husband and I absolutely loved Frank's home! Perfect location! The building is lovely and apartment was warm and welcoming. We will definitely visit again soon!

8116523,67974278,2016-04-01,62518115,Jenny,"This is my first time using airbnb and I am so glad that I chose Frank's brownstone. The location is convenient (a few minutes walk to the Public Garden, the Esplanade, Chinatown, Copley, Newbury Street, Public Transportation, and great restaurants!). Frank was very kind and made sure to check in on us before we arrived. His place was exactly as described and looked like the pictures listed. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked, and most importantly, the home was clean and spotless! I would highly recommend Frank's brownstone to anyone visiting Boston. Thank you again Frank! I can't wait to stay with you again. "
8116523,68710792,2016-04-06,33197331,Erika,"The apartment was as described- a cozy 1  bedroom.  
It was clean and Frank was a good host.  He stayed in touch during my brief stay to make sure that everything was OK.  
The neighborhood is lovely - peaceful yet convenient.  I was able to go to 2 gorgeous parks and walk to the T.  There is also shopping and restaurants nearby.  
Unfortunately I'm not able to give 4-5 stars because there was an unpleasant odor the whole time I was there.  It was dank, musty, and strong.  If that gets resolved, then I would be able to recommend the place.  
"
8116523,69010963,2016-04-08,59381879,Kate,Frank was a fantastic host. His apartment is clean and neat and has everything you'd need. It's in the very best part of the back bay in Boston in one of the original brown stones. I'd stay here over and over again.

The place is comfortable and has everything necessary for your stay. Frank is an amazing host -responsive and caring. He was very helpful and resolved an issue caused by FedEx - he personally came down to ensure my delivery which was misplaced was handed over to me. I'll certainly be glad to stay at Frank's again. "

O apartamento estava limpo e bem cuidado 
Muito bem localizado 
Recomendo "
8116523,73878309,2016-05-11,252679,Patti,"Such a sweet little apt in a primo location.  Lots of towels, blankets, pillows. Plus toiletries.  I loved the exposed brick and high ceilings in this street level apt.  Easy access to keys via lock box.  I never met Frank but he was very communicative. I wish I had more than one night.  Perhaps next time I am in Boston. Thanks again!"
8116523,75662395,2016-05-22,22297288,Patrick,"My girlfriend and I booked Frank's place for a long weekend get away and we enjoyed thoroughly,thanks to Frank's beautiful apartment. It was extremely clean and had great tips of local attractions as well as great directions for the apartment. We parked our car Thursday morning and didn't touch it until Sunday afternoon, it is in the ideal location, with the ability to walk almost everywhere. We will definitely look to stay here again next time we travel to Boston! "
8116523,75917496,2016-05-23,43516206,Chase,"Frank was a great host and the unit was extremely conveniently located for access to Back Bay, Fenway, and Cambridge - all within walking distance.  My wife and I enjoyed our 1-year anniversary in the home and it offered coziness as-advertised.  Would use Frank again."
8116523,76192334,2016-05-25,43217296,Eric,Frank's place is nice and as described. It is cry closed to Boston common and the beautiful Charles river. Frank us also very responsive from day 1 making our stay easy and pleasant!
8116523,76798505,2016-05-29,12939425,Andrew,"Great location and fantastic neighborhood. This was a premier way to experience Boston on the high end. Frank was helpful and responsive, and the apartment was well provided for. We look forward to staying again if we get the opportunity."
8116523,77952820,2016-06-04,28288734,Shar,Great location.  Very attentive host. Enjoyed every minute in Boston and would return to this listing.
8116523,80693200,2016-06-19,66235810,Greg,"We were looking for a local taste on our latest trip to Boston and that is exactly what we got with this listing. The location is excellent not far from great walking parks and the bustling Newbury St where you can find everything from sidewalk cafes to fine dining and all kinds of stores. The interior was very cozy, clean and comfortable. The exterior (entrance) of the place could use some clean up however as it seems some birds have nested high above the door and leave a mess down below just as you come and go from the place. The surrounding buildings also have their nice flower gardens and gates which this one could use. However these are just a couple aesthetic observances but it is still an excellent place to experience all that the Back Bay has to offer. I would definitely recommend it to others. "
8116523,86559498,2016-07-17,64169130,Noel,"Very nice place as described. The location was so convenient for getting to the local sights, shopping, and transportation. Very walkable. The beautiful Charles River Esplanade, Boston Public Garden, and Boston Common are only blocks away. 

Frank was very responsive to any questions I had. The extra bed was set up and ready as requested in advance of our arrival. Plenty of extra towels and sheets were available if needed. Would definitely recommend this place. 

The only (minor) issues were that the bar stools were too high for the counter, making it awkward for sitting at. Also, part of the rug is curled up and should be taped down as it was a tripping hazard. Still an overall great place."
8116523,87218286,2016-07-19,79051311,Andre,Perfect location!  A few blocks from Boston Public Garden and Boston Common.  Very close to Charles River and Newbury Street as well.  I walked everywhere!  The apartment was clean and in a nice neighborhood.  Frank was an amazing host.  He's very responsive and answered all my questions in a timely manner.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in the Back Bay area.
8116523,87686783,2016-07-21,55441835,Matt,Very welcome and very communicative and helpful. Thank you Frank.
8116523,88172622,2016-07-23,16363534,Louise,"Fantastic location.

The place was was picturesque and felt like home. Back Bay was lovely. Would like to come back and enjoy the fall color. My host answered all my questions and was knowledgable of the neighborhood. This was my first time using Airbnb. The bar was set pretty high. I truly recommend this home if you'd like the quintessential Boston experience. 
"
8116523,92849515,2016-08-10,78011671,Susan,"Frank made our first experience with Airbnb a good one.  Loved the location, very safe area, great amenities, exactly as pictured.  Would definitely stay again."

The weather was very hot in Boston during our stay but we were very confortable in the appartement.  Everything is clean and is according to what we see in the pictures.  Frank was very quick to respond to our questions. Thanks!
8116523,93976332,2016-08-14,12154350,Osvaldo,Description was accurate . Easy check-in. Definitely recommend this listing.
8116523,95999268,2016-08-21,41570354,Randy,The location is perfect. You get a great feel for how Bostonians live.  Food recommendations were spot on.

8116523,97350429,2016-08-27,16718987,Chris,"Frank's airbnb rental was as described.  It is a great location, very clean.  Frank is meticulous about communication prior to arrival.  I had no problems during my stay, and actually found the bed one of the most comfortable beds I've experienced in an Airbnb place.  Only downside is that noise from neighboring apartments can be heard (ie footsteps, sound of showers, etc...)"

8116523,101660582,2016-09-14,25441073,Heather,"Frank's place was in a lovely area and easy to get around. The unit was tidy and had everything we needed. Our only problem was that it was a ground floor unit and located under/beside the stairs and you could hear other occupants coming and going. The listing stated it was a guiet unit and we needed to keep the noise down, maybe that should be passed on to the neighbours upstairs ? "
8116523,104858353,2016-09-29,6197536,Alejandra,"This place is in a great location.  We were able to walk everywhere!  There are parks close by and great restaurants and shops just a couple of blocks away.  
Frank was very quick to respond to messages and check in and out went very smoothly.  
The only downside is that you can hear noise from neighbors.  But other than that it is a great place for a short stay in Boston!"

8116523,107674367,2016-10-11,59531900,Jeff,"Great communication with Frank.   Everything as advertised.    The location was perfect.    This was our first AirBNB, worked out great, thanks, Frank!   "
8116523,108355134,2016-10-15,76658691,Shana,"Perfect location for a city visit. Host had good, consistent and clear communication for check-in. "
8116523,108836933,2016-10-17,985476,Dana,"Excellent arrival instructions, clean place, very handy home guidebook, easy check out. Frank has it down to a science. We loved having a place to stay so close to Boston Common, Back Bay, and Beacon Hill. The kitchen appliances we a huge plus!

Just to echo what others have said, you will hear some street noise and footsteps from upstairs.

Highly recommend Da Vinci if you're in town for a special occasion. We also loved the Lessons on Liberty tour led by local historians. 

"
8116523,109001035,2016-10-18,4768733,Nisha,"Our stay at Frank's was great. The apartment was very nice and clean, plenty of linens and everything we needed, arrival very smooth, Frank was very quick to respond to messages. "

8116523,112555179,2016-11-06,78609189,Cindy,Frank was great at communicating with us after we made reservation and prior to our stay.  The neighborhood is wonderful.  Cozy apartment is very well maintained.
8116523,112905864,2016-11-08,50308513,Patrick,"Great location in one of the best neighborhoods in the city.  The bed in the bedroom is amazingly comfortable.  They do have a listing that they provide an optional second bed available.  This is not technically correct as the second bed is a blow-up mattress.  However, all and all the stay was great.  

A note on great service: I errantly left the keys inside the condo and didn't get off work until super late (after midnight) and the host was able to quickly help us out.  He came over and was able to let us in.  Big relief...and was super helpful.  "
8116523,113010453,2016-11-09,93430103,Wayne,Great location!

8116523,114081762,2016-11-15,22285195,Lydia,"Just got back from staying at Frank's apartment, and it was perfect for my needs, just a 20minute walk from the Hynes convention center and 20 minutes from the boston public library, public gardens, newbury street. Also has a great little playground just around the corner. The apartment was very comfortable, quiet. No washer dryer, but our stay was short enough for that to not be a issue. Definitely recommend!"
8116523,114587355,2016-11-19,7201454,Janka,"I adored staying at Frank's place. Located in the high-end residential neighborhood of Back Bay, it was a quick walk to the nearest T stop (Copley) and to the shops and restaurants of Newbury Street. The Boston Public Library is nearby and definitely worth a visit. I had a fantastic seafood dinner at the Saltie Girl restaurant just down the road on Dartmouth St. And for a nightcap, the Cheers bar is only a couple of blocks away from the apartment!

The apartment itself was lovely - clean and cosy and very quiet. It had everything I needed for a 4-night business trip, and Frank was even kind enough to make sure that I had an iron and ironing board to use during my stay. Frank was also a perfect host - making sure I had directions and that I checked in safely, providing recommendations for the local area, but otherwise just leaving me to it to enjoy my stay.

This was my first trip to Boston, and I can't wait to visit again - I'll definitely be staying at Frank's!"
8116523,120327248,2016-12-09,105068162,Shay,Frank place is near all the shops and everything is walking distance. If you don't want to walk then an uber ride to all the stores were no more than $5.00 bucks. Franks home was very spacious and clean. He even offers Netflix for free. This place was awesome. 
8116523,120756727,2016-12-11,4573586,Mike,Great experience! Perfect location in the heart of everything.
8116523,121375232,2016-12-16,37236308,Hannah,"Frank's place is clean, beautiful, and in the heart of the Back Bay. A trip to Newbury Street or the Commons is just minutes away, and public transportation makes the whole city accessible. Frank is a very communicative and accessible host. If you've always wanted to experience life in a Boston brownstone, stay here!"
8116523,123961483,2016-12-31,28792557,Loic,"Amazing place , and frank is a very concerned person, he will help you during your trip with a lot of tips and informations !"

8116523,128108277,2017-01-22,107876066,Fantasia,"This place was a great place to stay. Very close to great food and the park. Access to both the Red Line and Green. 
We are early to bed folk, and the neighbors who shared our bedroom wall were relatively loud until late, but that is to be expected on a weekend, and did not diminish our enjoyment of the place. 
overall, great stay!! "
8116523,128793653,2017-01-27,20684670,Jeff,"Great place! Really felt at home but right in the center. Near Backbay, Newbury and the Commons. Quiet and cozy. High speed wifi too!"

Apartment was clean and cozy. within walking distance to shopping and restaurants, perfect location to explore the Back Bay Area of Boston. would definitely stay here again! Our only recommendation would be to provide an easier way to watch TV or stronger wifi. The connection was not always good, we noticed with our phones too. Thanks!"
8116523,131082365,2017-02-10,109458220,Sarah,"Excellent communication with frank; quick to respond
The apartment is amazingly cute. Just as it is pictured. The bedroom can get a little hot overnight. We left a door slightly open.
So close to many attractions. Friendly neighborhood, very safe city in general. 
Will recommend frank and his place to anyone, and will definitely recommend Boston to anyone. Lovely city!!! We will be back!!!!"

8116523,133294361,2017-02-21,527989,Nicole,"Great location, cute single bedroom apartment in a classic Boston rowhouse. It is a busy street but the unit was pretty sound proof and plenty dark for light sleepers."
8116523,133599899,2017-02-23,21656477,Tristan,"The place itself was a bit small, but everything worked and looked great.  The fact that it's got easy access to South Station (and thus Logan too) is a real boon."
8116523,134244702,2017-02-26,38902109,Philipp,Great place to stay for a couple of days. Location can't be better and the apartment is simply beautiful. Absolutely recommendable!
8116523,135007517,2017-03-02,88524770,Léo,"Logement vraiment agréable, situé dans un quartier magnifique proche du Parc et très calme. À quelques minutes à pied des principaux quartier de Boston ! Frank est toujours disponible pour des questions et renseignements. Je recommande vraiment !"
8116523,137124410,2017-03-13,9271450,Jessica,This location is great for exploring Boston on foot. Fun neighborhood and close to great attractions. Public transportation is also close so you can easily get to other parts of the city. Really enjoyed our stay here.
8116523,137976487,2017-03-18,58359986,Bennett,"Great location! Frank communicated with me often. Noise from the above apartments was noticeable but not a bother. The memory foam mattress reminded me of home, and I slept well each night.  It was about a 15 minute walk to the Hynes convention center. I would stay here again. "
8116523,138379500,2017-03-19,40079413,John,"Very well located apartment, comfortable and clean. Frank is responsive and attentive. Certainly an enjoyable place to stay. "
8116523,139097022,2017-03-23,99107633,Erin,"Frank's place was easily accessible and an ideal location for getting to know Boston. He is central to Boston Common, Freedom Trail, Newbury Street and Fenway Park. As parking is difficult to find in Boston, it is easy to get around by foot. We loved staying at Frank's and would recommend his home to a couple or small family of 3. "
8116523,139750553,2017-03-26,36465767,Drew,This garden-level apartment worked great for my girlfriend and I to explore the city from - walking to Copley square for shopping and transportation was a breeze
8116523,140543535,2017-03-30,20201592,Belen,"The flat was just like the pics, really clean and close to all the touristic places, perfect location! :)

As advertised and recommended. "
8116523,143379200,2017-04-11,54765381,Cj,"WHO KNEW THE BEST COULD BE HAD SO INEXPENSIVELY!

This was my first time to Boston, so I had no idea I was planning a couple's get away in the heart of the city's most prime real estate. Beacon Hills is most beautiful. Plus, the wife was impressed with my choice - so extra kudos. 

A quick walk in either direction takes you to convenient food, shopping and tourist attractions including The Freedom Trail, Boston Common and the famed Cheers pub (yes THAT Cheers pub). If in town for the Marathon, the finish line is also in 'tired legs' walking distance. BTW the public library just around the corner is a can't miss site seeing locale. HOW IS THAT?

Frank's place was clean and cozy, and I would definitely consider booking again on my next trip to one of my new favorite stateside destinations. 

Still no Pats fan though - BOO!"
8116523,145876791,2017-04-20,48779254,Julia,"Frank's place is really amazing! You get to have the experience of staying in a traditional New England building but all the convenience and comfort necessary. Very well located, it makes really easy to go around and explore the town. Also, Frank was always very helpful and answer promptly when we needed informations. I would definitely go back and recommend his apartment"
8116523,146774924,2017-04-23,302373,Lisa,"Frank's apartment is centrally located, clean, convenient, easy check in. Frank is also very easy to comunicare with."
8116523,147551478,2017-04-27,5617936,Arianna,"Esperienza pessima! Appartamento senza chiave e con chiusura automatizzata. A causa della pioggia ( così come detto dal property manager) la porta non si è chiusa la seconda notte con il risultato che abbiamo passato la notte a fare la guardia. 
Abbiamo contattato subito l'host ma ci ha risposto la mattina dopo. Gli abbiamo chiesto di posticipare di un paio d'ore il check out per recuperare un po' di riposo e ha risposto no. Abbiamo quindi chiesto se potevamo lasciare le valigie fino alle 14 ( il nuovo Check in sarebbe stato alle 15) ma ci ha negato anche questo. 
Rigidità e inefficienza. Non consiglio a nessuno questo appartamento. "
8116523,149067114,2017-05-02,115335312,Lisa,The location was the best --- quiet neighborhood but Beacon Street does have traffic.  Very homey and comfortable.  Would definitely stay here again... heck I would live here!!!  BEAUTIFUL area/city.
8116523,151408784,2017-05-12,126683495,Noura,"Frank was great host, quick response to my emails, the shower had shampoos and conditioners just like home with good quality products. Location was good as well."
8116523,153642537,2017-05-21,90292436,Debbie,"We enjoyed our stay.  Frank's place is clean and comfortable. It is within walking distance to the markets, restaurants and the train station. "

8116523,159076224,2017-06-09,13000199,Mark,"Franks apartment is in a great situation in Back Bay close to shops and restaurants and Boston Common. 

Easy walking distance to all sights. 

Communication always quick and helpful."
8116523,160541139,2017-06-14,64255796,Anand,"Amazingly central and walkable to Newbury Street/the convention center/etc. 
The place was clean and had an overabundance of linens and towels!

I highly recommend it!"
8116523,162124917,2017-06-19,13406519,Eszter And Aubrey,"A nice little apartment with a great location. We had some problems with the TV and some other questions, but Frank replied every message in just a few minutes and he was very helpful.
"
8116523,163146369,2017-06-23,113594538,Nicole,"Frank's apartment is even nicer than the photos suggest, and the neighborhood is fantastic. Frank was very quick about responding to messages and even provided me with a lot of information before I decided to book the apartment. I had an incredible stay in Boston, and this apartment (and Frank!) was a large part of what made it so great. "
8116523,172070439,2017-07-19,19400745,Carrie,"Great location for access to Back Bay, Beacon Hill and the Esplanade. Only downside is that the bedroom doesn't have windows, so it got a little stuffy at night."
8116523,176223220,2017-07-30,6705551,Anna,Amazing location
8116523,180162506,2017-08-09,3433996,Cris,Fantastic location on one of the best streets in Boston. Having a private entrance was a huge plus.
8116523,185044439,2017-08-20,93569431,Jerry,"AMAZING spot. Perfect location, beautiful inside, cozy, clean, and classy. Do it"
8116523,189427069,2017-09-01,33482893,Loc,"Frank is nice and quickly reply. The place is close to the central, it took 8min walk to the green line train station that would lead you everywhere. The property is abit old ( it is brown brick)."
8116523,189739750,2017-09-02,107409326,Logan,"Frank's place is great.  Wonderful location that is convenient to good restaurants, shopping, and bars.  Would definitely stay there again next time I visit Boston!"
8116523,190521751,2017-09-04,93924806,Leah,awesome location and easy check-in and out. Perfect spot for a mother-daughter trip to the city!
8116523,191479775,2017-09-07,90772860,Kerry,"Frank's place is very conveniently located.  The apartment is pretty much as described in the listing and other reviews.  The only thing that made my stay less than great was that the walls are somewhat thin so at times you can hear the neighbors.  This was mainly a problem when I could hear the neighbor at 4am on a Wednesday singing a mix of 90s and early 2000s hip-hop and pop music, but that may have been an anomaly."
8116523,191676187,2017-09-08,41052351,Siobhan,We were really looking forward to our stay at Frank's place as it is in a great location. The apartment was nice however we were unable to stay and subsequently cancelled our reservation because the front door which opened onto the street could not be secured either from the inside or the outside. When I contacted the host he said it locked just fine and was unwilling to discuss the issue by phone. He did eventually send someone by to try to fix the door but they were unsuccessful. We booked into a hotel but ending up losing our first of two nights in Boston because of this issue. Thankfully Airbnb refunded us without delay.
8116523,192511933,2017-09-10,15088420,Steve,"Perfect location and close to the ""T"" stations (Copley, Arlington). Would definitely consider staying here again the next time we're in Boston.  The host was great at communicating and keeping in touch."
8116523,193197541,2017-09-12,81204263,Zhan,"Frank's apartment is exactly as described, clean, quiet and in the most desirable location in Boston.  The one bedroom apartment is perfect for two and can accommodate up to four.  Frank sent over the checkin information timely and always responded quickly to my questions.  We totally enjoyed our stay there."
8116523,194350559,2017-09-16,142677558,Janette,"This is a beautiful apartment in a beautiful building on one of the most beautiful streets in the Back Bay.  Apartment small but exquisitely designed, with exposed brick walls, wide-plank wooden floors.  Just a few blocks from the Esplanade along the Charles River which is ideal for morning jogs and evening walks.  Perfect location in multiple ways: 2 blocks from Boston Common and Public Garden; short walk to the State House on Beacon Hill and in my opinion it's one of the most beautiful state houses in the country with its golden dome.  about 7 mins walk to the Green Line stop of Arlington, which means you can get to Museum of Fine Arts, Isabella Gardner Museum, Symphony Hall, the splendid newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, now gathering the 3 earlier collections into one stunning space.  And of course there are fabulous restaurants and bistros a short walking distance away.  Do spend lots of time browsing Newbury Street and Harvard Square."
8116523,196294497,2017-09-22,70526508,Mary,"We loved our stay in this pretty, little apartment. We walked to everything. Our host gave us great ideas of where to visit and eat. Wish we had a few more days."
8116523,197726075,2017-09-26,111849100,Harrison,"This Airbnb is in the heart of beacon and perfect location to get to places. Kind of small, but perfect for 2 people - maybe a third on the air mattress. You are going to spend most of your time in the city, this place has all the necessities to come back and get some sleep."
8116523,199681603,2017-10-02,142618674,Ruth,"Frank was very responsive and ensured we had all the information we needed in order to access this property seamlessly. Where it is located is central to shopping, parks, the Charles river and historical sites. If you love to run and plan to do so on your trip, as I did, this is a great location to stay. Plenty to do in this area and everything seemed to be a walk or an inexpensive Uber ride away. Thank you for your hospitality Frank, and thank you for making my first bnb experience a positive one."
15314772,107942570,2016-10-13,11594411,Renee,"We had a great stay in Boston and it was largely due to the location of the apartment situated in the financial district. Our host was very responsive to any questions or needs. We were the first guest in the place so a few things were needed and received. Beds really comfy too. I can't emphasise how great the location was, near the food markets, freedom trail, wharf and more. We found the Government Car Park that had 24 hour 3 day minimum parking for $15/day in advance a 7 minute walk away - we parked the car and walked everywhere.  We were a family of 6 and would be suitable for couples also. Would 100% stay there again - great city great apartment."
15314772,109920093,2016-10-23,98868382,Valerie,"Great location! Spacious. No key required, just codes which was convinient. "

15314772,112565479,2016-11-06,98411371,Susan,We really enjoyed our stay. All the information to get into the home was provided before we arrived.  The place was very clean.   The financial district is pretty quiet on the weekends. Many of the cafés are closed. We did have easy access to the North End to visit our daughter and have great meals!   Overall this is a great place to stay and we will stay there again in the future. 
15314772,112904220,2016-11-08,30676388,Stacy,"Condo was great. It's a great location for exploring the city and near the wharf. Because it's right in the city, it could get a little noisy from the street but that's to be expected with a city condo. The only issue we had - the beds are brand new and very firm so it effected our sleep a bit. Everything else was great and Taylor's staff were very accommodating. I would definitely recommend this condo. "
15314772,113261034,2016-11-11,504817,Scott,Great location! Good for two people.
15314772,115047329,2016-11-21,101225676,Marv,Great place in awesome location. Host was prompt in replying to any questions before arrival. We would definitely stay again. 
15314772,117225221,2016-12-05,104007074,Eugene,"We were only in town for a brief stay stay and this place worked out perfectly. Close to the T, restaurants and night life. Very comfortable and quite. "
15314772,120313781,2016-12-09,104166471,Katie,Taylor's home was beautiful and planning our stay was seamless. Loved the location and the apartment.

15314772,124339043,2017-01-01,47047736,Shaoyuan,"In downtown Boston, near a lot of attractions. Big space, nice and clean. We all enjoy it!"
15314772,125584912,2017-01-06,11074329,Dawn,"Great flat, great location. Near bars, shops, restaurants, harbour, walking distance to common and historical trail, aquarium, local transport and much more! Had a great time here!"
15314772,125959024,2017-01-08,61008441,Karlee,This apartment was in a perfect location. We were able to walk everywhere we needed and public transportation was also very close by! The apartment was clean and accommodating. 
15314772,127224118,2017-01-16,44111336,Nancy,"The perfect location to explore Boston. Walkable to the North End, the wharf, the aquarium, Haymarket, Faneuil Hall.  Fun local bars right around the corner.  Super clean. Perfect for two - four people.  Easy on street parking too."
15314772,127584810,2017-01-19,16622239,Seth,This place was great. Super easy check in and everything was exactly as described. Would highly recommend.  
15314772,128083380,2017-01-22,95678572,Alison,"This space is in a very good location. There is a wonderful deli below and plenty of bars in the immediate vicinity. Beds are pretty firm, however bedding is comfortable. Also most importantly, this is walking distance to many local attractions and a very central location to many other attractions. The space was very quiet on the weekend days, however be aware that it is very loud on weekend mornings due to the location. However, the washing machine did not work and we were only supplied with 6 towels, no wash clothes, and no face clothes for our 4 day stay. Jess however was very easy to contact and resolved any questions or issues promptly."
15314772,128306538,2017-01-23,107291577,Robin,"Outstanding place in the heart of the city, excellent communication made for an easy stay. I highly recommend this space!
"
15314772,129196922,2017-01-29,15768640,Helentina,"Taylors place was great!! It was very well located to everything my friend and I wanted to see and do on our weekend in Boston! We didn't want to leave and Taylor was nice to let us check out a little later! While there is no parking available on site, there is one that was conveniently walking distance. The place is great for a quick trip with basic amenities and great working heat for the winter cold. Checking in was a breeze and very convenient. The place lists a king size bed but it seemed to be 2 different size mattresses placed together which made it a little awkward to sleep on. The kitchen has basic amenities but some of the dishes were a little dirty. Overall, a great stay for a weekend trip! "
15314772,130532060,2017-02-06,34579497,Nick,"Taylor deserves the utmost consideration if you plan to stay in Boston for not just a night.. but even up to a week. I stayed with 5 other friends and the price was affordable and well worth it. Even locals were impressed when we told them how much we paid to stay in the financial district of Boston.

As far as the inside of the apartment goes; 
- 2 clean bedrooms (slept 2 each)
- 2 single pull out cots
- 2 full bathrooms
- large tv on wall (might have been 55""-60"")
- reliable wifi (accessed Netflix easily)
- kitchen essentials included silverware, 1 pot, 1 pan, and glasses
- large refrigerator
- high top table in living room (seats 6)
- washer & dryer

In regards to the location, it was as close to perfect as it gets. We were within walking distance to 711, CVS, local bars, restaurants, Battery Park, & the Quincy Market

Taylor's recommendation to download ""LYFT"" was greatly appreciated as it took less than 10 minutes for the 6 of us to get where we needed (TD Garden, Sam Adams Brewery, ""Cheers"" Bar, & Apple Store).


"
15314772,131507805,2017-02-12,38397710,Graham,"Taylor's apartment is spacious, in a great location and was perfect for a group of 4 of us. The couch is big enough to sleep someone if you need and there are two other rooms which can comfortably sleep two people. Everything was clean and the kitchen is remodeled. It's comfortable enough to come home after a long day and relax, but not SO spacious to where you never want to leave. Go out and enjoy Boston!"
15314772,134882263,2017-03-01,87473914,Lynsi,"Loved our stay at Taylor's! Perfect location, I brought my three year old to the aquarium and was worried about all the walking, but it was ideal! It took maybe 5 minutes tops. The condo was clean, and check in was very smooth. Building is a little noisy very early in the morning, but We will definitely stay again! "
15314772,136123284,2017-03-08,36203219,Tyler,"Great spot, so clean, highly recommend!"
15314772,137146664,2017-03-13,49818408,Mike,"The place was awesome.  Perfect location, tons of cool places only a short walk away.  Check-in was super easy and any questions I had leading up to our stay, were responded to within an hour or two.  "
15314772,137310500,2017-03-14,14054564,Roberto,"Super nice location, clean and beautiful apartment!!"
15314772,139790787,2017-03-26,11276808,Gretchen,We were disappointed. It said 4 beds but no sheets for sofa bed and no way to turn second bed into two since no sheets for this either. Washer broken and microwave broken. No on street parking anywhere nearby; cars get towed at 2 am so parking claim is bs. It was noisy with loud people overhead. But mostly it was the 4 beds was in fact 2; and the broken appliances.
15314772,140236211,2017-03-28,117645665,Kevin,"Clean, central location. Very easy to communicate with host. "
15314772,140551416,2017-03-30,19183514,Ke,Overall it's good. There is no parking the closet parking costs 51 a day. It's a 2 bedroom apartment instead of 4 bedroom. No breakfast provided. 
15314772,142482835,2017-04-08,14664394,Junghyun,Good

15314772,147968946,2017-04-29,18745740,Lonneke,"Great location, little bit noisy on weekend nights. Appartment is great for 4 people with to bedrooms en bathrooms. Large kitchen. If you plan on cooking diner yourself (like we were) there are only 2 pans; and there's a large oven but no oven dish. But if you're planning on eating out, that's no problem.
Enjoyed our stay."
15314772,151141706,2017-05-11,51858058,Jinyao,Pretty good and easy check-in

15314772,153962761,2017-05-22,65819303,Cindy,Good location
15314772,154467594,2017-05-24,21619739,Alejandra,Great place. Only warning is watch where you park your car. We thought we were safe and still got a parking ticket. 
15314772,155687620,2017-05-28,109031471,Tammie,The home was better than advertised.  It was very spacious and comfortable.  The location made walking to all points in Boston a possibility.  It was close to two T stops so that was another plus.  We will surely stay here on our next trip to Boston.
15314772,156153264,2017-05-29,16465994,Ricardo,"Taylor's place is definitely where you need to stay to reach every corner of Boston. Super central to tourist attractions, easy to move to outer places of interest since a metro station is very close, and very quite after a long day of walking / watching the sox win / eating at Italy town (North End) / bar hoping / etc. The place is exactly as depicted in the description and can't be more cleaner. Me and my friends stay only for a night (last minute reservation due a problem with our airplane (URL HIDDEN) this was a saver), but it will be my next go to option next time in Boston."
15314772,158197629,2017-06-05,51179739,Samuel," 

We enjoyed our stay, it is a great place, in the middle of everything, thank you for accepting us as guests."
15314772,158426305,2017-06-06,46653168,Christopher,"Excellent flat, awesome location, great value, super convenient to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and downtown attractions. If you're heading to Boston for work or play, you cannot do better than Taylor's place. Period."
15314772,158829981,2017-06-08,4477643,Carrie,"Location is great for restaurants and walkable to many of the must-see sights.  No need to travel far for food, drink or entertainment.  Really like the live entertainment in bars around.  "
15314772,159991277,2017-06-12,116150692,Suzanne,"Great location easy walking distance to many great areas like harbor and Quincy Market, the Common and the T.  "
15314772,162800893,2017-06-22,109714493,Cindy,Good location and close to a lot of restaurants and shopping. Parking is expensive and street parking is limited 
15314772,163103115,2017-06-23,63633699,Heather,"Great place, nicely laid out and super location. Nice and clean and updated with furnishings and decor. The king bedroom was a bit noisy so if you are not used to city sleeping or are a light sleeper, maybe not the best place, but if you are used to noisy city living, then go for it. "
15314772,165322686,2017-06-30,116076344,Kent,"Fantastic location! Very quick access to anything in the downtown area--Quincy Market, Freedom Trail, Boston Commons, etc. and no problem getting to anything else since there are multiple T stops close by. Great value, especially when the ability to sleep 5-6 people is needed.

We didn't bring a car and you definitely don't need one when staying here."
15314772,167081444,2017-07-05,119286392,Roelien,"This apartment is really light, modern and nicely decorated.  It is located in the financial district which is a great location, very central and only a few minutes walk to pretty much everything! Being a business district however, this did mean that some of the coffee shops etc. were closed over the weekend. Check in and access to the apartment was excellent.  

On the down side, upon our arrival, we noted that there was hardly any toilet paper in the bathrooms - the one toilet had a quarter roll while the other had absolutely nothing.  While I know it is a self-catering unit, having at least one roll per bathroom should be a basic requirement for arrival.

Despite several previous reviews about the washing machine being broken, it was  still not working, which was a huge inconvenience to us as we were counting on being able to do a load of washing as Boston was only the start of our trip.  The electric kettle was also not working, however there was a stove-top kettle provided in the kitchen as well.

This is a good apartment to stay in if you are not planning on cooking meals yourself and rather eating out.  Most of the kitchen cupboards were empty with only the very basics provided.  There was only one pot and pan and for instance no mixing or serving bowls.  We were only provided with 4 drinking glasses, which were different sizes and there were no wine glasses available.

I think also its important to note - if you have trouble sleeping when there is light coming into the room, I need to advise that due to the way in which the windows arch at the top, the blinds do not block out much light which means that the lights from surrounding office buildings do shine into the room.  This is however only a problem if you are sensitive to light when sleeping. "
15314772,167718546,2017-07-07,25773054,Paul,"Stayed with my wife, sis, and 1 year old son. Plenty of space and great location. Wifi is solid. Master bedroom has poor hvac ductung and is much warmer than the other two rooms. Linens are not great. Bring your own."
15314772,171425096,2017-07-17,13793864,Oscar,"Taylor's apartment was great! Very accurate and we had great communication.  On our next visit to Boston, we will definitely stay their again. Thanks for everything!"
15314772,177680418,2017-08-03,86289235,Julie,Bon remplacement pour visiter boston a pied. Propre et fonctionnel. Mais pas de communication avec notre contact sur place.
15314772,178055914,2017-08-04,139947283,Amy,"This was a lovely apartment. Walking distance to most attractions in downtown 
Boston. If you are a country dweller you will find it very noisy at night - trucks, people talking ..."
15314772,179038695,2017-08-06,116988005,Ant,"We had a really good stay at Taylor's place. Taylor and his associate Jess were very easy to get in contact with. Jess was extremely helpful with any of my questions. 
The location is superb - close to absolutely everything. The apartment was very clean. 2 large double bedrooms, although for 6 to stay the pull out sofa bed wasn't particularly comfortable. We also had issues with working the washing machine, I'm not sure if it is in working order. 
The kitchen is clean and enough appliances but basic supplies if you were planning to eat in were low. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend Taylor's place.  "
15314772,180401848,2017-08-10,121223630,Kelly,"Great location to the aquarium and to the hop on hop off bus. Also to the outdoor shopping center. Great restaurants near by. Clean apartment, has everything you would need to cook a meal. Enjoyed our stay very much."
15314772,181392534,2017-08-12,76967394,Lauren,"You cannot beat the location of this place. It's so close to some of the best areas of Boston and you truly experience life downtown. People were pretty loud outside on Friday night when we were there but not nearly as loud on week days. The place had quite a few light bulbs that were out and hadn't been replaced, which I thought needed to be done. There also weren't a lot of towels, like hand towels. None of these issues were a huge deal but for the price I paid, I was expecting a little more. Still, I would stay here again because of the amazing location."

It would be nice if they had extra toilet paper and small shampoo/bath soap. We ran out of toilet paper. Also, I'd suggest they get some better linens. They're very thin and you can see through to the mattress. Besides that, it was a good value for the Location."

Only negatives were just small niggles, rather than big problems. No shampoo, night lightbulb in bedside table (which was mentioned in another review).. 

But overall, a great place."

Definitely pack toiletries since there was no shampoo or body soap. Would definitely recommend this place though since location can't be beat! Apartment was very clean and check in was super easy!"
