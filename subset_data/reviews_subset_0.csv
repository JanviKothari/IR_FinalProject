11498523,64741601,2016-03-07,29868930,Petra,Ricardo was very nice and flexible with the check in time which was super appreciated due to hitting lot of traffic on the way to Boston. Place was clean and bed very comfy! Would recommend to anyone who's coming to explore Boston! 
11498523,65999787,2016-03-18,61264824,Ryan,"While we didn't get to meet, Ricardo was excellent, making sure everything was ready to go upon arrival.  He was readily accessible by phone if anything was needed.  The room was great for my short term need.  Ricardo was also accommodating with late check in, which was great.  The area was convenient to the Blue Line, just a short walk away."
11498523,67625673,2016-03-30,30705310,Daisy,"Although I didn't get to meet Ricardo during my stay, he was quick to respond and instructions to check in were very clear. There are french doors and a curtain that separate the room next door, that being said the walls are thin and you can hear conversations from the other room. My boyfriend and I didn't mind it, but other people may want to know. There was no body wash or shampoo even thought the listing says essentials. I didn't really mind since I brought my own anyways. The listing says private/entire home but I believe we shared the bathroom with other guests as well. Bed was very comfy! Studio was clean! Near the blue line & neighborhood was quiet. Would recommend!"
11498523,68481477,2016-04-05,57302343,Miki,"Ricardo was a great host. He prepared everything before arrival, and always answer call/text quickly. The apt is clean and simple, and it seemed linens in guest room looked pretty new. Even though there were some problems at the house, he tried the best to solve. The area is nice and quiet, only a few minutes walk from T station. "
11498523,69113136,2016-04-09,35949251,Laurent-Philippe,"Ricardo seems to be a nice guy.

However, the description stated it was the whole studio and it was only a room. Kitchen and bathroom are shared.

I had several allergies and I am sorry to say the studio was not clean. 

Furthermore, the separation between rooms is only a simple door with windows (fortunately with a curtain) and you can hear everything that other co-locators say or do. I did not had any good night to sleep.

I am sorry, but although the location is ok and close to the metro, I can not recommend this studio in any way."
11498523,70013390,2016-04-15,45919117,Nina,"Ricardo is a really nice guy and a super host!  :) He answers quickly through (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and is very often in the hostel, so he can help immediately. 
He did his job very well.
The kitchen was the best equipped ever, there's everything that sb needs to cook. 
The location is awesome! Just 3 mim to subway and 10 to downtown.
 
Thank you Ricardo!  ;)"
11498523,70553591,2016-04-18,21571308,Peter,Host was great with communication. Location was great and accommodations were perfectly adequate. Awesome location if you're trying to access Boston metro or have quick access to/from the airport.
11498523,72869396,2016-05-05,40435015,Rosy,"The neighborhood was nice, the downtown area of Boston is all of 5 mins away. Ricardo was very welcoming and always responded quickly to any messages sent. The room was nice and clean, as was the shared bathroom and kitchen area. You could here all the fellow roommates but we didn't find it bothersome. All in all a great place!"
11498523,73817399,2016-05-10,10982982,Erick,"I rented this room for a cousin who was meeting up with us for a couple of days while we stayed there for almost 2 weeks. This room actually had a huge closet so if you need to hang your clothes, this would be the room I would pick."
11498523,74144614,2016-05-13,14527228,Jonas,"Very close to the airport, good public transport connection, supermarket (Shaw's) not too far and of course great view.
On the other hand it's not fancy and quite small, the walls are thin as mentioned everywhere and in that particular room the covered glass door to the next room has about an inch room to the ground, which makes thin walls obsolete. But since everyone was respectful during our stay, that's not a real issue.
Haven't met Ricardo, but he was very helpful via messages!"
11498523,74908585,2016-05-17,41319485,Channy,The listing is just as it is described! Clean and cozy and comfortably located. Riccardo is also very prompt with his responses.
11498523,76036531,2016-05-24,61147593,Troy,"Had a great experience with Richardo, was very friendly and quick to email back.  Would recommend this listing for anyone who is looking to travel to Boston. "
11498523,76541519,2016-05-28,37318164,Stefan,Small but cosy room with excellent connection to downtown Boston. I would definitely recommend it. :-)
11498523,77463587,2016-06-01,56387424,Steven,Nice Stay. Nice neighborhood. Ricardo always kept the place clean. Very close to trains and beautiful ocean view. 
11498523,77680403,2016-06-02,47119865,Karina,"The place was great. Super easy to find and very clean and comfortable. Great host, great place. Will use again!"
11498523,78098124,2016-06-05,13219332,Shannon,"Ricardo's place was just what we needed for three people for a few nights. He was very helpful with booking as we needed two rooms for two different lengths of stay. His place isn't fancy but it was clean and it was great that we had access to the fridge because we purchased a lot of beer that needed to be kept cold to bring back with us. We saw a few other people during our stay but most of the other guests kept to themselves. Self check-in was a breeze and when we ran into Ricardo cleaning he was friendly and asked how we were doing. 
We didn't use the T at all, we just used Uber and no trip was really expensive ($15 or less) into Boston/Seaport area where we had an event. "
11498523,78728337,2016-06-08,41721549,Binita,Location is great. Very clean rooms.
11498523,79345433,2016-06-12,74504364,Shruti,"Listing description is accurate.
Kitchen and restrooms are shared.
There are 2 restrooms.
Location is very convenient. Very close, I think 0.2 miles ie 4-5 minutes walk from Blue line T station (Maverick).
Close to the airport and financial and seaport districts. Nice residential neighborhood, off street parking."
11498523,80250715,2016-06-17,76103589,Nicolas,The apartment is as described. The location is very convenient. We appreciated our short stay. 
11498523,86288244,2016-07-15,26681461,Nathan,"Check in was super easy, Ricardo sends you all the information you need. The building is near a subway station, which makes it easy to reach from the airport and to get to the city. 

The room / hostel has all you need to stay a few days in Boston. It was clean, although the building is quite old and could use a renovation in some areas, especially the bathroom on the second floor.

All in all you get a good and uncomplicated accomodation for the price."
11498523,86917347,2016-07-18,38966911,Grant,It was great! Hostel is close to the Maverick station and it's definitely a livable place 
11498523,88969159,2016-07-26,18430418,Ollie,Ricardo's flat was really great. Perfect location (I recommend Eddy C's for a late night drink...) and really good and simple communication. We had such a good time in Boston and would definitely recommend his place. 
11498523,89430596,2016-07-28,48818431,Landon,Everything was exactly as advertised.
11498523,90204166,2016-07-31,57236985,Carolina,"Todo estuvo bien las fotos concordaban con el lugar, indico la direccion exacta y siempre estuvo en constante comunicacion cuando lo necesitabamos."
11498523,91022641,2016-08-03,45037814,Markus," I love my short we can get away in Boston.
 I was minutes away from public transportation and at night I had a great  waterfront view of the city.

 My host  provided me detailed instructions about checking in and checking out and there was also a car service if I  elected to use it."
11498523,91243771,2016-08-04,85313331,Paolo,"Room was quite large, with space enough for a couple of suitcases.
Bed was not 100% clean, same for the bathroom on our floor. Bigger One on the second floor was a Little better.
House is only a few minutes walking from Maverick underground stop.
Neighborhood was quite calm, even if some noise originated from a close house under construction."
11498523,91472875,2016-08-05,67131316,Yu Jia,The room is great! It's near the airport  and the subway! It's really a wise choice to live here.
11498523,92034544,2016-08-07,6121546,Jackie,The location is great for those how don't have a car. We had our car and was able to parking it in the provided space and leave it there while we explored on foot. Train is so close and is connected to everything. Very clean and if there was AC we wouldn't want to leave. Thankfully there was a fan provided or it would of been too hot to sleep. I recommend staying here. 
11498523,93113221,2016-08-11,83182081,Ankita,"The place was nice and the location was great too. Few minutes walk from blue line. The room was clean and the kitchen was convenient too. Ricardo was really nice, he accepted my request on the same day I booked to stay, in such short time. He had everything setup well, the check in and everything. Definitely recommend, especially for travelers.  "
11498523,94367191,2016-08-15,41294535,Lea,very good place 
11498523,95573656,2016-08-20,84227840,Olga,"Nuestra estancia en el apartamento ha sido muy agradable. Hemos estado muy cómodas, estaba todo muy limpio y la gente que se ha alojado en el resto de las habitaciones eran muy respetuosas, parecía como si tuviésemos el baño y la cocina para nosotras solas cuando lo hemos necesitado. Lo recomiendo 100%. Los padres de Ricardo son muy amables. Esta situado en un barrio tranquilo con metro que te lleva al Centro en una o dos paradas muy cortas. A las traseras del apartamento hay unas vistas maravillosas de Boston, un lugar privilegiado para contemplarlo de día y de noche y hacer preciosas fotos. Gracias a la familia por su hospitalidad y limpieza."
11498523,95976852,2016-08-21,66824077,Hayato,"ホストの方々はとても優しかったです。爪切りなども貸していただいて、よくしてもらいました。
空港から一駅でアクセスがとてもよく、部屋への入り方も非常に分かりやすかったです。"
11498523,96761340,2016-08-24,21888083,Kattlynn,"This Airbnb experience was a last minute booking which the host was very quick to accept and clearly communicate instructions for self-check in and check out.  The building and the room was welcoming, clean and cozy, and just a few minute walk to a nearby subway station to get around. The bathrooms were clean and never had much of a wait despite being shared among other residents. A much appreciated fan was provided in the bedroom to combat hot nights, as stated in the description there is no AC.   The free parking right next to the building was also a plus.  I would definitely stay here again if in Boston for the price and no fuss arrangements! "
11498523,97479646,2016-08-27,78124071,Maddie,"Ricardo's place is very convenient and offers everything needed for a stay in Boston. I loved that it was so close to the Metro Blue line, and offered a full kitchen. Everything was very clear and easy!"
11498523,97790935,2016-08-28,3834356,Scott,Great Host!! Very helpful. Great location very close to t station. Quiet neighborhood. Bare bones accommodations. 
11498523,98911823,2016-09-02,62701541,Carrie,"Room was very clean, quiet. Neighborhood is close to the airport which was good for us. Close to subway to get downtown. "
11498523,99564110,2016-09-05,80519757,Clare,"Ricardo's place does what it says on the tin. If you're looking for a cheap and cheerful place to get your head down and sleep off the jet-lag, which is super close to the airport, then this the spot for you. It is a typical hostel and no frills, with the usual delights of a shared bathroom - but clean and comfy. Ricardo is always busy cleaning! Everything was great re check in and the Maverick area is fine - lots of shops and cafes and a nice bakery on Maverick Sq. There's a lovely view nearby over to Boston downtown which was fab for the Labor Day fireworks. The glass doors between rooms referred to in other reviews have now been covered over with a mock mdf wall, which I think shows a good host listening to feedback. The only downer re room3 was that it is next to the kitchen and communal area so a bit noisy at times, but guests were generally respectful and my jetlag meant I would have slept through a disco. Thanks Ricardo for being a great host."
11498523,100129237,2016-09-07,13921130,Jacob,"Ricardo was incredibly friendly in greeting me (he lives downstairs), and very responsive over email. The room was precisely as described: spare, but with a very comfortable bed and strong wifi. This is definitely a no-frills kind of place, but in a great spot near the T and at an excellent value. "
11498523,100303361,2016-09-08,92029926,Valeria,"I slept like a baby, my bedding was professionally folded and smells so fresh and clean. checked in with no problem at all. the place is cozy and super clean. The shower is amazing, and there was not 1 type of shampoo, there were 3 for different hair types, thank you Richard to be so mindful. The best part was that I found the Colombian bakery in the morning making amazing empanadas walking out the house. Recommended"
11498523,101061378,2016-09-11,2660497,Nick,"My wife and I wanted to visit a place on the east side of Boston given how much they've been redeveloping it. It is one of the only areas I hadn't visited! Saw this hostel-like room available and jumped at the chance. Room is as described! No frills, just a bed, a fan, and access to a bathroom / kitchen and social situations. If you're a social butterfly, you'll love this place! If you need a place to stay, it's so close to nice running paths and metro stops that it's worth it."
11498523,101667549,2016-09-14,93247543,Peter,"I found the apartment very accessible by the subway from the airport, only 1 stop.
It was clean, very spacious and just like the pictures online.
this was my first time using airbnb and I was very pleased I did.
Next time I am in Boston I will definitely see if this accommodation is available. 
I didn't use it to its full potential as I was out a lot, but there were full kitchen and dining facilities available if needed.
The contact I had with the owner was very friendly, quick response and I was given all the information I needed.
loved my stay in Boston."
11498523,102061242,2016-09-16,46160882,Lee,We had a awesome stay.  The place was a great location to the train station making it easy to get to and from the airport and around the city.  We got to speak with Ricardo and seemed like such a pleasant person.  This place was just we need to lay down at night.  The small kitchen seem adequate for light trackers need.  Thanks again for making our trip one to remember. 
11498523,102887437,2016-09-19,44798603,Virginia,The room was exactly how it was shown in photos. The apartment and room itself were clean. It is a great pick for something simple and is only 20-30 minutes away from downtown Boston via the Blue Line. Ricardo was able to help us immediately when we had questions arise. 
11498523,104966779,2016-09-29,93034012,Gv,Excellent location with proximity to where we needed to go. Was listed as whole Apt/Suite but turned out to be hostel rooms with shared bathrooms - a new experience for me! Ricardo was a very responsive host.
11498523,105163598,2016-09-30,16478557,Tori,Easy.  Straightforward.  Convenient.  Clean. There was a lot of construction going on outside that started very early in the morning but that is clearly a temporary issue that's outside the host's control.  Very basic and efficient accommodations at the most affordable rate.  Very close to logan airport and downtown. Other guests were also very courteous.  
11498523,105630574,2016-10-02,94009207,John,"Overall this place was fine but there are some things to be aware of - admittedly it was our first AirBnB experience.   

Location - if you plan on spending s lot of time in Boston proper - financial district, Seaport, Freedom Trail - know that due to traffic and having to cross the river every time it will be a $13-20 Lyft/Uber trip each way.   Also East Boston doesn't seem to have much to do.   Some small shops and eateries but where this place is is not a neighborhood with much in it for visitors. 

Noise - if the other hostels are rented you're going to hear people - and inevitably someone will be in the bathroom when you want to go in there.  

The bed was ok - but for us mid-40s people we were board stiff every morning.  It's s matters on a platform - no springs.  

Very very spartan - if that's for you then this will work.  Ricardo was kind enough to help bring our bags up.  "
11498523,106869999,2016-10-08,33242398,Kaitlyn,Ricardo's hostel was simple and what we needed for crashing during our time in Boston. This room is right off the kitchen and was a bit loud. Communication with Ricardo was simple and straight-forward. Location to the T and airport was highly convenient. I would recommend this listing for solo travelers and couples.
11498523,107169396,2016-10-09,34317027,Edgar,"Great location, easy hosts."
11498523,107657492,2016-10-11,96597363,Julia,a lovely stay
11498523,108549726,2016-10-16,97071456,Amaia,"El alojamiento cumple de sobra con lo que estábamos buscando: alojamiento sencillo y económico, limpieza y ubicación. lo Lo mejor de la casa es la ubicación y la limpieza. Está situada a cuatro minutos de la estación  de metro, dos paradas al centro de la ciudad y una al aeropuerto. Los baños son compartidos con el resto de los huéspedes, hay uno por planta. También hay dos cocinas en cada uno de los pisos. Ricardo es un buen anfitrión, contestando rápidamente los correos y dándonos todo tipo de facilidades."
11498523,110183810,2016-10-24,35930424,Michael,"The hostel was decent. Rooms were fairly clean. Ricardo was great with  communicating with me and ensuring all my hospitality needs were met. 

The neighborhood was quiet, family-friendly, and a 5-minute walk to public transportation to downtown Boston. 

The only issues were the images online were misleading and did not match the real thing. Above all, I had a pleasant experience and would recommend if you came to explore all day. "
11498523,110972723,2016-10-29,85994311,Bianca,Nice place good communication from host :)
11498523,111239348,2016-10-30,101735358,Gabriel,place was very cozy and conveniently located
11498523,111909607,2016-11-02,74080651,Xiaofeng,"This place is very clean,quiet and so close to the airport and subway station. The kitchen is well-equipped which let me to cook some home food coz after a long flight I miss it so hard.
By 5 mins walk there is a beautiful waterfront where you can enjoy the boston city view.
Ricardo is soooo nice and helpful. if I had any question he always responded quickly. When I had a big trouble with my flight ,he offered me a place to keep my luggage and llet me feel free to use the common (URL HIDDEN) really helped me a lot. 
Dear Ricardo ,Thank you for everything you've done!"
11498523,113009795,2016-11-09,10982982,Erick,"A pleasant experience as always. This is the second time I've stayed at Ricardo's place and I stay here weeks at a time. He keeps the common places clean and well kept. I also like the little touches he added like the new locks in the bathrooms, big towels and shampoo in the shower. It will definitely save me space in my suitcase next time I come in since I don't have to bring my own towel and shampoo. This room might be my preferred room to stay in. I previously stayed in the room above it but this room is more spacious and has a huge closet to hang clothes. His place has become my go-to place whenever I go to Boston."
11498523,113719926,2016-11-13,70562156,Nuria,"The host was very polite and helpful. The location is very convenient. However, the walls are so thin that you can hear everything that goes on at night. It was difficult to sleep with noise from other guests (e.g., snoring, talking and others)."
11498523,113960883,2016-11-14,2808216,Stephan,"It was a nice private room in a hostel. Although we never saw our host in person, the check in was easy. "
11498523,114198899,2016-11-16,28911540,Danielle,Very easy check in/ out! Perfect for staying overnight before an interview the next day. Quick and easy cab ride to the airport. 
11498523,114438368,2016-11-18,102424830,Alberto,"Great place, clean & spacious. Located at just steps from the train, one stop away from down town. More like a hotel than a hostel though, it was very quiet and you barely encountered other guests."
11498523,114852589,2016-11-20,67166486,巧,easy to access to subway
11498523,116673959,2016-12-02,99427351,María,Ricardo es un muy buen host! Está pendiente de las necesidades y de las inquietudes :) las fotos y la información suministradas están de acuerdo con lo que se encuentra en el lugar. La estación de metro es muy cerca! 
11498523,121723748,2016-12-18,100201847,Jackie,"Nice place if youre looking to spend a little time where you stay. The kitchen was nice and clean as well as the rooms. 3rd floor is significantly warmer than the 2nd floor so keep this in mind for winter travels. The showers provide shampoo and conditioner so you dont really have to bring any. There is construction outside which was extremely annoying and neighbors are noisy as well. HOWEVER, this was a very nice place for the price and its super close (about 2 minute walk to maverick station where you can catch the blue line train to downtown within 2 stops/5-10min) to the metro and some shops. Would stay again and would recommend the 7 day charlie pass if staying for an extended time, it allows unlimited travel including buses and ferries"
11498523,134690999,2017-02-28,57527619,Lisa,Thank you!
11498523,135593686,2017-03-05,83803525,Yunan,It is really cheap!!!
11498523,137437910,2017-03-15,74407153,Li Min (Lily),It's a nice snd affordable place that's conveniently located near Maverick Station (Blue Line). I had a pleasant stay :)
11498523,137793167,2017-03-17,2753076,Matthew,Ricardo is a great host! Very friendly. Would definitely recommend to friends. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We wish we could've stayed longer!
11498523,138330109,2017-03-19,117127046,Michelle,Great location and Ricardo is awesome!

11498523,140717502,2017-03-31,89819740,Markus,"Gute, günstige Unterkunft um Boston zu erkunden ! Sehr nahe am Flughafen "
11498523,142304932,2017-04-07,3763901,Ashley,"Ricardo's place is steps away from the station and only a stop away from the city or airport. The place itself is in a quiet neighbourhood, clean, safe and easy to get in and out of. Photos are accurate. The housekeeper was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. Ricardo was very prompt with his messages and replies. Overall, a very peaceful and spacious place to stay and would definitely stay again.

Note: people with large/heavy suitcases be warned of stairs only and narrow passageways (although we were able to navigate these fine). 

Note: there is a bit of construction going on at the moment. It did not bother us so much (I was even able to do work all day from the bedroom) but for those who need a completely silent night's sleep, try elsewhere until construction is done. "
11498523,142882167,2017-04-09,123805385,Karl,"Good place, close to the subways. "
11498523,143832633,2017-04-13,38417252,Stefanie,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Ricardo. Er hat uns sehr nett empfangen und alles gezeigt. Wenn wir wieder nach Boston kommen, checken wir wieder bei Ricardo ein! :)
"
11498523,145264819,2017-04-17,92351451,Eric,Ricardo is a great host
11498523,145729619,2017-04-19,124162664,Megan,My first air bnb experience and I felt very safe and comfortable here! Ricardo answered all of my questions very quickly! 
11498523,147591069,2017-04-27,23937918,Ciril,"We had really good times at Ricardo's hotel. The arrival is facilitated and 24h/24, the room was clean and perfectly located around the metro and easy access to downtown."

11498523,152829096,2017-05-18,111297621,Debbie,It was a nice place. Kinda interesting to share space with a bunch of other travelers. But it was well maintained and you couldn't beat the location!
11498523,153068005,2017-05-19,12197430,Jess,"This is a great and economical place to stay if you need a little respite during a layover. The amenities are well appointed and the neighborhood feels safe (we walked from the airport at 1:30a with no problems or worries). Shared bathrooms and kitchen are clean and tidy, bedroom is comfortable. The keyless entry is such a wonderful feature for coming in at all hours, and not having to worry about coordinating a key exchange. We'd definitely stay here again!"
11498523,153289088,2017-05-20,8910448,Kenny,It's a nice enough place. We just needed to calibrate our expectations that this was more of a hostel
11498523,154030198,2017-05-22,128699531,Joseph,"Definitely got what I expected with this place. It has a very young hostel like feel, where you can chat with other guests in the common areas and get a sense of what interests them about Boston, which I personally enjoy. The place was quiet at nights, but one short metro stop from the down town area. It was clean and had any basic amenity you might need  while visiting a city. Check-in and check-out were very easy. "
11498523,154679328,2017-05-25,130288373,Kazue,Convenient to the center of Boston. Neat. Reasonable rate. Richard is very nice and helpful.
11498523,156892947,2017-06-01,38708619,Mingqian,"The location is very good, near the subway station. The self-check-in and out works very well. Highly recommended."
11498523,157122787,2017-06-02,132695092,Christian,Awesome location and stay! Very close to the airport and made the trip extremely convenient and comfortable for my girlfriend and I. Would definitely go back and recommend to others!
11498523,158194398,2017-06-05,1777302,Sonia,Enjoyed our stay at this Airbnb.  Our room was clean as was the shared bath. Having a kitchen at our access was a pleasant surprise even though we didn't use it. Ricardo was a perfect host and very helpful. Great value for Boston. 
11498523,158417851,2017-06-06,133294333,Andrew,"房间干净,床很舒适"
11498523,158830216,2017-06-08,132676494,William,"Ricardo was a helpful, friendly and communicative host and he provided a very nice hostel-like experience. "
11498523,159051096,2017-06-09,127924916,Kristin,First time using Airbnb and I'm so glad I did. Great area! Couple minutes walk for a FANTASTIC view of downtown Boston and close to the airport. Neighborhood is was decent and check in and check out was easy and hassle free. Saved HUNDREDS of dollars staying here rather than a hotel. Would definitely recommend!
11498523,159787489,2017-06-11,133381910,Nicole,"A great location to stay, scenic location, 2 mins walk to the best view on the skyline of Boston, Could have stayed their from the early monring to the late night. Good access to public transportation. Clean rooms, well equipped, has everything you would need in a town....Ricardo is very caring about the needs of his guests and very responsive in case of questions. Was a great experience to stay at his house. Always again.  "
11498523,160133073,2017-06-12,104408,Ellen,"Great place if you are looking for convenience to the T line and the airport.  Expect more of a youth hostel -- no frills -- experience, however.  Clean and high walkability, with parking, which is a major plus."
11498523,161044160,2017-06-16,132118202,Daniel,"Super convenient location, Ricardo was very helpful!"
11498523,161868656,2017-06-18,35315389,Samuel,Very convenient location and accommodating host! Thanks for the wonderful stay. 
11498523,162148496,2017-06-19,78143168,Rafael,Great place :D
11498523,162373877,2017-06-20,134241022,Socrates,"Ricardo es un excelente anfitrión, muy preocupado de los detalles. Todo está bien dispuesto y muy limpio. Las indicaciones para llegar, hacer check in y check out son muy claras y precisas. El lugar está muy bien ubicado y muy cercano a sistema de transporte público."
11498523,163129933,2017-06-23,95036841,Gabriel,"It was very easy to get to Ricardo's place from the airport. My lock was waiting for me in my door when I got there. Overall the house was very nice, clean, and in a quiet area.  It was a very short walk to Maverick Station, and from there a short commute to the rest of Boston. The house itself was a little hot, but it was summertime and there was a fan in the room so not too bad.  I often saw Ricardo offering guests advice about the city.  Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in Boston.  Thank you Ricardo for a great stay!"
11498523,164295666,2017-06-26,55464236,John,"This place worked out great for visiting  Boston as an affordable place to stay. No AC, but with windows open and provided fan, room was comfortable close to water. Neighbourhood seemed very safe. Not much around, but close to metro to get into city cheap. Ricardo the host is super friendly and super helpful. Place is like a hostel... worked out great. Lots of bathrooms and kitchens. Whole long weekend we barely bumped into anyone else and when we did, everyone was super friendly.  Would stay again and recommend to anyone just wanting an affordable place to sleep with hot shower and kitchen in safe neighbourhood where you can count on friendly host. "
11498523,164534694,2017-06-28,63783943,David,Ricardo is very professional and helpful.  Completely satisfied with my stay.
11498523,166168757,2017-07-02,34996335,Alexander,Great location and a great host! Ricardo was able to accommodate us on very short notice. On site parking was an added bonus. The room is basic but charming and clean. Would recommend any time!
11498523,166488988,2017-07-03,24158457,Kaity,"Ricardo's place was perfect for our last minute airport layover. We had an overall awesome experience. Very clean, great communication, and a nice sized space for our short stay. The house is super charming. Feedback I have to give is that the room got extremely hot and there was no air conditioning. The fan was good but didn't do too much to cool the room down. The sheets were scratchy. I would stay again in cooler months. :)"
11498523,166771656,2017-07-04,6329287,Daniel,"Great place to crash, especially if you need to get to the airport. Ricardo is friendly and super responsive. Definitely recommend. "
11498523,167127778,2017-07-05,4951986,Federico,Super easy to reserve and perfect place for a quick layover in Boston. Great location too. 5 minute drive to airport and 10 minute train to the city. 
11498523,167389541,2017-07-06,86151698,Hilary,Super convenient to airport
11498523,167695277,2017-07-07,7450284,Claudia,This room was great for the price. Location was within minutes to the subway and a cheap Uber ride to the north end. Ricardo was really helpful and suggested a one day list of must sees for Boston. Thank you! 
11498523,169456883,2017-07-12,139915078,Liam,Great place and great stay in a vibrant neighbourhood!
11498523,170966374,2017-07-16,10128697,Dirck,Dichtbij vliegveld en openbaar vervoer. Goede prijs- kwaliteitverhouding.
11498523,171476041,2017-07-17,74285681,John,Great communication about the place so you know exactly what to do. Clean and easy to find. Great place and close to downtown.
11498523,172333961,2017-07-20,117256292,涟,"非常好,环境很好,交通也很方便。如果我的朋友去波士顿,我会推荐给他们这家住宿的。"
11498523,173059150,2017-07-22,80777092,Suzanne,"We liked the idea of an Airbnb hostel. The place has an image of an studenthome, which is nice. Our room on the other hand was really, really hot & the curtains were to small for the window. Bed was fine!"
11498523,179503357,2017-08-07,80815664,Susumu,Good place. Less than 10 minutes walk to the station.
11498523,182838778,2017-08-15,76245642,Carla And Jane,This is a hostel not an air bnb... the picture is not even the correct building.
11498523,183240652,2017-08-16,5411109,Bartosz,Wow. This place is awesome.I felt very comfy there. Nice price and You are almost in the Boston center.Metro line is just 5 min walk. Clean rooms and well equipped kitchen. Highly recommended.
11498523,183943200,2017-08-18,2130279,Pádraic,"Great location for an airport overnighter- clean, very basic, next to airport. Could do with proper curtains."
11498523,184991507,2017-08-20,144830284,Dean,We had a great time staying here and would definitely chose this location again!
11498523,186435285,2017-08-24,144700155,Andrew,The location was great! A quick 3 minute walk from the T station. The room was a good size. The parking worked out perfectly. I would recommend this place for people looking for a close stay to downtown Boston.
11498523,186830159,2017-08-25,19003037,Adrienne-Rae,I couldn't for the life of me find the light for the bathrooms. I needed a place to stay the night before heading out to an early flight in the morning and this place was less than 10 minutes to the airport. It's a fine place to stay for a short while.
11498523,187241985,2017-08-26,86918239,Daniel,"The bed was a little low to the floor but still comfortable. Everything seemed clean and the location was great. Couple of blocks to the water, and stores and restaurants near by. No frills in the rooms, but kitchens are easily available."
11498523,187837867,2017-08-27,48206566,Emily,"This was a solid landing spot for my overnight in Boston. I loved the location: quiet neighborhood, but only takes 15 minutes to downtown (2 blocks to subway and then 1 stop). Also, I was staying by myself and felt very safe when walking around during the day. The place itself was good - not much to write home about, but it's exactly what I needed: comfy pillows, fan to keep cool and a quiet house."
11498523,188495972,2017-08-29,55015209,Sheherezade,"La verdad es que el alojamiento esta muy limpio, y el tamaño de la habitación era aceptable. El colchón y la almuhada sorprendentemente cómodos. La cocina no la usamos pero era pequeña y con un uso poco práctico. Pero lo peor fue que en nuestra habitación no había persionas y teníamos dos ventanales justo encima del cabezal de nuestra habitación. La farola de delante estubo toda la noche encendida...como comprendereis no pudimos pegar ojo...Y para más inri la casa de al lado esta en contrucción y las obras empiezan a las 7 de la mañana...vamos fue impossible pasar una noche decente."
11498523,189118878,2017-08-31,146050675,Erin,"Good stay near airport.  Kind of far from city center, but close to the T.  Place was a little cramped, but overall nice.  Only bad things were no AC and the WIFI did not work."
11498523,192061664,2017-09-09,146458647,Christian,Alles reibungslos
11498523,194030848,2017-09-15,139100939,Rafael,"O local é tranquilo e bem próximo ao metrô. Há bastante opção de locais para comer, principalmente comida latina . Pensei que havia esquecido um item no quarto e o atendimento do Ricardo foi extremamente solicito. Os únicos poréns foram o fato do quarto ter um odor um pouco desagradável de mofo e o banheiro pequeno."
11498523,194862452,2017-09-17,60421191,Katherine,Great location! Nice meeting other travelers who were staying there too!
11498523,195270876,2017-09-18,150116733,Jim,Great spot to crash if you're into the bay and don't mind being outside of the main city. The waterfront park is so nice and there's a tavern right across the street with a kitchen open until 11am. And some a few snacks after that. Shared kitchens and bathrooms were well kept and daily cleaning was going on. Overall a great spot to stay in east Boston for a good price too. Really enjoyed room #6 window set up.
11498523,195504724,2017-09-19,137160734,Juan,Airbnb hotel is good for quick trip. It is really close to the airport and the aquarium. I enjoyed so much.
11498523,195995724,2017-09-21,60346378,Drew,"My bedroom entrance was through the kitchen so I had to go though that to get to the bathroom. This made my room noisy. There are lights outside the room and unfit curtains so the room was bright all evening. Finally, the bathroom was extremely unclean. I stayed here because of price and proximity to the airport as a place to get a quick nights sleep.  It was not worth it and I would not stay here again."
77691,193365,2011-03-06,199218,Stijn,We had a great stay at Hermina's house. Very convenient and easy to get to Boston. Thxs !
77691,223781,2011-04-11,484868,Michael,"This was my first time using airbnb, and I'm happy to say it was a great experience. Hermina was a great host, friendly and accommodating. It's a nice residence, and a comfortable room & bed. 

There was a little bit of a mix of over when/how we would pick up the key, but she communicated quickly and we were able to to deal with it easily. 

Highly recommended!"
77691,231687,2011-04-19,417279,Jill,"Hermina's place was very close to the redline station, a grocery store, mcdonalds and 1 restaurant. Her house is literally 5-10 minutes from downtown Boston on the train. The house was clean, the room was large enough to accomodate my sister and I. I would stay there again!   :-)"
77691,236759,2011-04-23,513979,Helen,"Hermina was very welcoming and hospitable. My room was large and comfortable, and the house is very convenient to public transport for getting into town."
77691,261317,2011-05-12,427618,Audrée,The room was lovely and Hermina was really nice. I would definitely come back if I have to traval again in Boston!
77691,263324,2011-05-14,563651,Claudia,"The house is so nice and the bedroom is  very conftable. The place is very well located, it is close to the train and some supermarkets and restaurants."
77691,283689,2011-05-27,564122,Jenny,Hermina is nice and friendly even though I did stay longer enough to know her in person. I wish I could stay for more nights. The house is gorgeous and the room I lived is clean.  
77691,304270,2011-06-08,105086,Salana,The room we were in was very spacious and comfortable. The house is located close to the Red Line Train which is very convenient and also there is few eateries near by along with a grocery store. She is a very good host as she was helpful and loved to share as well. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend her if you are visiting Boston area. Thanks Hermina :) !!
77691,314208,2011-06-14,512771,Chiu Kuei,"I  like Hermina and her house very much. She is a very nice host. She allowed us to make our breakfast with all her food  when we stayed there for two days. The gust's room is comfortable and big. Her house is near the train station, easy to connect to other places. She also like  help her gusts, like borrow her jacket to us when we did'nt wear clothes enough. We appricate her very much. Hope meet her and stay her house again.   
"
77691,324523,2011-06-20,117565,Charles,"Hermina is a gracious host and her house in Dorchester is very comfortable to stay in as well as being convenient to the Red Line of the Boston MBTA. I was put in one of the two basement rooms, which disappointed me at first, since the pictures all seemed to show light and airy rooms on the second floor, but the actual room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The room had a bathroom/shower just outside, which is shared with the other downstairs guest. There is also a handy washing machine ($1.00) and drier ($1.50) in the shared hallway. The only disadvantages to the downstairs room is that there is not a lot of sunlight coming through the tiny window, and the room is a bit damper than the upstairs part of the house. Breakfasts were hit and miss, as there are often many other guests and eggs and bacon and juice can disappear quickly. However, there was always something to eat and I certainly didn't starve. The wi-fi worked well, so I was able to do my email and check out the weather and other Boston activities. All in all, I'd say it was good value for $55/night in an outer neighborhood in Boston."
77691,329399,2011-06-22,706482,Greg & Denise,"this is a great place for the price, close to the city using the t-rail. We stayed in the basement on a warm night and it stayed cool. The only issue is with an old house you have the creaks of everyone walking, the pipes running with everyone using water. But that was part of the charm of staying in an victorian house in Boston. "
77691,334410,2011-06-25,295822,Jon,"I wanted to stay with Hermina, but ended up not having to.  Still she was very communicative and a very generous, thoughtful host.  I really appreciated her efforts to make sure I was alright."
77691,342542,2011-06-29,656764,Mike,"It was a good experience for me. Easy access to the T subway, quiet street and a nice host. It is everything you needed away from home without a big price tag. Will come back if visit the city again!"
77691,357297,2011-07-06,723175,Bashir,"Hermina is a really nice person. We used the kitchen and she even left fruit out several times. 

She wasn't there when we arrived- but no worries just walk in and grab a room. But when we met her she was a great host. Thanks!!!"
77691,376826,2011-07-16,786925,Jackson,Stayed at Hermina's house for a week while I was looking housing.  She is a wonderful host with clean rooms and even provided clean bath towels!   
77691,391557,2011-07-23,810804,Laramie & Wendi,"Hermina was a lovely host.  She was very communicative over eMail and phone and I felt secure knowing I'd have a place to stay.

She has several units, in the same building.  The one I was in was a basement unit, which was great for July, because Boston was HOT.  The unit was very cool, and had a nice shared bath with the other basement unit.  It had a little kitchenette, loads of space, and very easy access in and out.  It felt like having a full apartment to myself. Available street parking was a big plus for me.  Getting there was easy, you're out on the Red line, at Fields Corner, and it's just a few blocks from the station."
77691,392946,2011-07-24,719327,Erik,"We were very satisfied with the accommodation Ms. 
Sarkissian in Boston provided. She was a very generous and kind lady. 
"
77691,406970,2011-07-30,668878,Mike And Sarah,very good trip.  easy to work with and very accommodating.  close to the T - subway.
77691,416036,2011-08-02,692540,David,Really nice place to stay - good facilities and a good location! Hermina was very helpful when i saw her as i was out most of the day sight seeing. Well priced!!! Thanks Hermina!
77691,423582,2011-08-06,773346,Danny,"Very nice host :p We had great time to talk. Just be sure to reserve the biggest room ;) the one with 1 flower sticker ;)

The subway is just at 2minute from there and great restaurant around."
77691,430125,2011-08-08,905725,Ralph,"Hermina was a very gracious host; the house was very quiet during our stay. It is located behind a local Boston police station - word of advice, do not park in their parking lot! .

While not a traditional BnB in the sense that the host prepares meals an such, it offers convenient access to the city from her location. She did have breakfast items available and you have full run of her house."
77691,438157,2011-08-11,614272,Joe,Hermina was very helpful and her house is in a great location!  I had a great stay!
77691,450708,2011-08-16,862818,Judith,"Hermina was very nice. Beware the long, steep staircase if you have a lot of luggage or if it is heavy. Hermina helped me carry my bag up. The neighborhood is pretty neat, but off the beaten path, so if you want to stay in a more touristy part of Boston, go elsewhere. However, if you like authenticity and good Vietnamese food, stay here. Although it is not close to the airport or South Station, it is an extremely convenient ride on the T and a short walk from Fields Corner station. I had no trouble getting there even with my heavy suitcase."
77691,475484,2011-08-25,990162,Julia,Nice place to stay!!! And Hermina is pretty nice.
77691,481765,2011-08-28,933084,Chloe,"Hermina was an excellent host. We were put in one of the basement rooms, there was a double bed and a fold out sofa bed, with a shared bathroom with the other basement room. The room was quite dark but suited our needs fine. we were 4 young travelers exploring boston and this was a good place for us, the room was not the best room in the house and some people may be disappointed by it. The house is located just around the corner from the tube station which has good links to downtown boston. Breakfast was included and use of the kitchen was allowed which made eating very cheap. "
77691,495373,2011-09-02,891668,Tina,We enjoyed our stay at Hermina's.
77691,515913,2011-09-09,970901,Ruby,让Airbnb社区的其他人知道您的入住情况。这将出现在列表页面。
77691,520165,2011-09-11,805495,Garrett,"For the price you cannot beat this in the Boston area.  Reasonably close to Boston, 45 minutes on T or if you take a cab it's $20 and it still takes about 30 minutes depending on traffic.  

Just remember this is an AirBnB stay.  Everything is nice but it is not perfect.  It's better than the Fenway Park Howard Johnson's for quality but it is definitely not a 4 star hotel and the price is appropriately reflected.  

One issue that we'd like feedback from the host on.  There was no key to the individual rooms.  I had some items I would prefer to keep locked but there wasn't a key available.

Otherwise it was a nice stay for however short it was.  "
77691,568929,2011-09-26,979326,Melissa,"As my first Airbnb experience, I can say I was not disappointed. Hermina was a very nice and helpful host. The location was safe and the T red line is a 6 minute walk from the house. A very useful place if you simply need a place to shower and sleep."
77691,581513,2011-09-29,1120910,Andreas,"Es war mein erstes AIRBNB Erlebnis und ich kann sagen, das es besser eigentlich nicht kommen konnte. Ich hatte ein schönes Zimmer, mit in dem Haus, das neben gutem TV, auch Küche, Bad etc hatte war ein zweiter Mieter. Hermine ist ausserordentlich freundlich und gastfreundlich. Der Stadtteil ist nicht der allerbeste, aber sicher und nah an der Redline, man kommt immer überall hin.
Andreas"
77691,590801,2011-10-02,237059,Heidi,"Don't risk your time and money.  Here is my unbiased review:

This was a misleading experience with bad room condition, worse condition than $20 hostels I've stayed at abroad.  The room location changed twice, and upon arrival at the second confirmed room location, the key we found under the mat (as instructed) did not fit in the door.  Upon calling Hermina (the host), she said that the person might still be occupying the room that was reserved for us (she wasn't sure), and said she had another room for us.  It was not a room, it was a dusty, low-ceiling attic with poor lighting and an air mattress.  The sheets smelled of urine odor.  There were old sneakers propping up a small window.  This neglected space had random stored items scattered in it, clearly not a place to put paying guests.

We were confused and disappointed, but didn't complain, being it was late and we were tired and none of the rooms we were promised were available.  We reluctantly slept on the uncomfortable air mattress in the attic, and booked out of there asap in the morning.  I wish there had been an alternative.  For $70, this is nowhere close to the condition I would have expected.  Though it's conflicting that there have been good reviews for this host and location, it's possible no one else has had to sleep in the creepy attic.  So, just letting you know - don't let that happen to you.

I have used AirBnB before, and my past experience was by far- much better than this one.  I really enjoy giving great reviews, and am disheartened to have to report this as a bad one."
77691,599957,2011-10-04,1190048,Janusz,The host canceled my reservation 11 days before arrival.
77691,625173,2011-10-13,183917,Jim,"Very inexpensive price and convenient location to central Boston. I would recommend the rooms in the basement/cellar which are 2 larger rooms with kitchenettes and a full bathroom shared between them. There are 4 rooms upstairs which share 1 full bathroom and there is an additional half bath (WC) downstairs next to the kitchen. The attic/loft room is quite large. For those who prefer a room and bathroom which is well cleaned on a daily or so basis, you may want to stay in a hotel."
77691,701296,2011-11-07,107522,Stefania,"Unfortunately we didn't know Hermina personally but we spent a nice time in Boston. The house is great and the location is perfect.
"
77691,743828,2011-11-25,1373249,Shoeb,My friends stayed there. She is pretty cool. The place is awesome!
77691,948771,2012-02-26,1641954,Calisti,"Very nice place, close to the train station and very easy to access. Downtown is at 15 minnutes. "
77691,1021221,2012-03-19,1915427,Frazer,"Hermina is awesome!

Would recommend her place and definitely stay their again!

"
77691,1076234,2012-04-02,2028005,Jamie,She is so friendly! The sheets were soft and the room was nice!
77691,1116718,2012-04-12,1903064,Kathrin,"I spent ten days at Hermina's and enjoyed her company and care. Her hospitality really exceeded all my expectations, she shared her dinner with me, took me for a walk on the shorelines and was helpful and generous in many other ways.The house is spacious and beautiful, and so was my room. Commuting downtown and also to the Harvard campus was relatively fast and convenient - the train station is very close by and all  important spots in town can be reached within 30 minutes. I also enjoyed the very relaxed check in policy - my plane arrived quite late in the eveninng, so Hermina just sent me the door code so that I could let myself in at any time. "
77691,1259221,2012-05-10,1138376,Carlos," I was in Boston for interspaced job interviews so i hung at the place for over a week, at the best price in time. Hermina is simply cool, she is friendly w/o being intrusive, she's not a big talker, but has big eyes and a sunny disposition, the house is wellkept,  rather free and trusting. The neighborhood has now a large Vietnamese presence, and if you are up to it, you can meditate at 5:00 am in the Buddhist Center across the street. At nite, the trek from the metro to the inn is comfortable, about 3 blocks, and largely safe, but there are a couple winos on the corner, that warrant being cautious, though not afraid.  The House has beautiful floors, and the rooms vary from large to small, according to space requirements and budget, but they are al clean, comfortable and either cool or warm, as you please. The big plus is the washing, dryer machine.  The kitchen is tea oriented, and there is an abundance of honey, and that description just about says it all. In sum, for its price, there is nothing charmer. Enjoy. "
77691,1287195,2012-05-15,2212443,Yangshen,"Hermina is a very nice hostess. Her house is so great and everything is well organized. She provided all we need when we stayed in her place. The house is located in a safe area and it's easy to each red line subway. In a word, I am really enjoy my stay."
77691,1327435,2012-05-22,2051114,Alejandra,"We visit the house in May 2012 with mother and boyfriend. The house is nice and relatively clean. Hermina was a nice host, but she didn't spend too much time in the house because the house was full of visitors. The neighborhood is a little bit scary at the beginning but nothing bad happens there really. The Vietnamese restaurant at the corner is great!  And the subway is close enough.  The rooms were big and clean, and very comfortable. The only problem with our rooms was that it was very close to the bathroom and other visitors woke us up in the middle of the night when they use it.  The other issue was the breakfast (that was included) the second day there was no bread, milk... that might have been also because there were lots of visitors. But overall I think is a good choice for Boston."
77691,1341134,2012-05-24,1569281,Door,"Hermina is very friendly and makes you feel totally welcome in your house. We were only there in the evenings, very comfortable bed and air bed for third guest upon request. Not in the center or very touristy part of Boston, we would recommend going for something bit more central if you want to be in the buzz (takes 15-20 min by subway to South Station). Also, don't expect a clean cut hotel room; you are staying in a house with a personal touch. "
77691,1399830,2012-06-02,2223981,Jiang,"Hermina is such lovely person I met and make great company with.
I was lucky when she was in weekend she took me to the beach we did walking around,that is just perfect for me.
Everyday we had some conversations and happiness.
Her house is a proper home so beautiful,colored nicely too.
Great great times to stay
Indeed will recommend it to others.
"
77691,1408334,2012-06-03,2344201,Tydus,Hermina was very helpful. Provided me with directions on how to find her place. Great breakfast and conversation. Was a gracious host all around.
77691,1416579,2012-06-04,1172627,Caroline,"Perfect accomodation!
"
77691,1435349,2012-06-07,1026914,Dennis,"Hermina was a wonderful and supportive hostess. The Victorian home was elegant and tastefully and colorfully decorated. She provided coffee, snacks, cereal etc... The guests from around the world were fun to talk with.  The room was very clean and when I extended a day, but my room was taken that night she moved me easily to another room. I will stay there again when I visit Boston.
"
77691,1438446,2012-06-08,639317,Martin,"We stayed in Hermina's attic loft, wich was great, spacious, clean, and spacious enough for 4-5 people.

We will return when next in Boston.
"
77691,1453215,2012-06-10,2573727,Carlos,This was my first experience using Airbnb and Hermina made it simple.  She was also very helpful and extremely kind. She even allowed me to use her washer/dryer.  Thanks Hermina!!
77691,1488251,2012-06-15,2567603,Philip,Clean and nice room
77691,1511081,2012-06-18,2595432,Ana,"Herminia was really nice with us.
is easy to get to her house. 
and close is a lot of Vietnamese restaurant"
77691,1644777,2012-07-06,2341140,Maggie,Hermina has a lovely house. The bedroom we used is big and the bed comfortable. Breakfast is minimal. We met Hermina briefly. Her instructions for reaching the house and accessing the room are good. The neighbourhood was noisy with firecrackers for 4th July.
77691,1661038,2012-07-08,835797,Tim,A great room with convenient transport connections (about 25 minutes on one subway line) to the center of Boston. Hermina's communication before and during our stay made things very easy.
77691,1779324,2012-07-23,2741854,Gianfranco,"We stayed two nights in Hermina's appartment. The bedroom, with shared bathroom, was clean and comfortable enough. Unfortunately, we asked for a three person accomodation but we got one bed only!. We tryed to contact Hermina (that was not in Boston in that period) but we were unsuccessful. So one of us had to sleep on the floor for two nights! Very unseemly!!"
77691,1982473,2012-08-14,2722964,Lais,Hermina was a good host and we had a great experience!
77691,2128566,2012-08-28,3247944,Gilles,"My daughter and I loved the place because of Hermina which is so friendly.
A great place to stay, very convenient

77691,2170534,2012-09-02,2449832,Jaime,"I stayed at Hermina's and everything went as planned. Easy to check in and out. Only saw Hermina for a brief moment, but she was very welcoming!"
77691,2261680,2012-09-11,2237556,Marloes,Hermina has a wonderful house at a great location. It's very close to the T line. She's a good host and very kind to us and our baby boy. She made us feel like we were at home! 
77691,2311279,2012-09-17,3316505,Peter,"lovely old style house, really close to the train station. Very easy access to centre of Boston. Would return. Hermina is very courteous and friendly."
77691,2345899,2012-09-19,3360879,Melanie,Nice house with beautiful rooms in a very mixed neighborhood. Close to the T and just a few stations to the city center - very convenient for people like me who need public transport! Hermina is a great host! She even took me to the Armenien church when I told her I had been to Armenia and was interested in the country.
77691,2488368,2012-10-02,3475947,Sefi,"Hermina is a great host, very worm, open and care.
We enjoyed staying at her place.

77691,2514707,2012-10-05,3609473,Emma,Our first Airbnb experience. Hermina was a wonderful host who made it easy for us. The place was great and thanks to the location we experienced some of the real America. Thank you!
77691,2617966,2012-10-15,199926,Alexander & Laura,"Host was helpful with b&b travel accomodations. Although, it was not spotless, host makes up for it with hospitality. "
77691,2753214,2012-10-29,3865559,Muhammad,"Wonderful stay ! All amenities are working & Hermina was good host. The area is also surrounded with good places to eat and all, also easy to reach from any direction in Boston. I will deffinitely come back when in Boston."
77691,2853313,2012-11-10,3096227,Amir,"I really enjoyed Hermina's home, and appreciated her wide range of guests from around the world. Our room was spacious, the bed was very comfortable, and I enjoyed the neighborhood as well."
77691,2953614,2012-11-24,3504507,Vonnet,Would definitely stay in one of Hermina's properties again whenever we're in Boston. Excellent host!
77691,3154740,2012-12-25,4271667,Tianyu,Hermina is great. I had an awsome time staying in her house. She keeps everything very clean. The house is so convenient to get around. I recommend here for people who come to Boston for a short visit.
77691,3685151,2013-03-04,4818890,Ingrid,"I stayed in Hermina's house in the first 4 weeks of a longer stay in Boston. Hermina is very nice (she offered dinners several times), the house is big and reasonably clean, and my room -- it must have been room B -- was big and very comfortable. Dorchester, the neighborhood where the house is located, is not the richest (and also not the most expensive) place in greater Boston. In any case, the red line (with the field corner station really close to the house) enables a quick connection to downtown Boston. While I have moved to another place in the meantime (mainly to avoid to commute every day), I would definitely return to Hermina's house for a shorter stay."
77691,3740958,2013-03-10,5266084,John,"I really enjoyed my stay at Hermina's home. There was a brief mix-up with the room at first, but Miller, who helps Hermina out, promptly resolved the issue. I had no difficulties locating the house. It is very pleasant and comfortable, located just a short walk from the train station. The room was a little cool, but there were enough blankets to keep warm. I hope someday to return, and maybe get the chance to meet Hermina in person."
77691,4354551,2013-04-29,2394642,Steffan,"Hermina excels at giving that true Mediterranean warmth and hospitality. Upon entering her home you immediately feel welcome and I just had to take my shoes off at the door because its like coming home to Mamma! The kitchen is filled with delicacies and me and my two sons felt like princes our whole entire stay. Keep up the good work, Hermina!!!"
77691,4408915,2013-05-03,5909856,Celine,"Great room and house!
Enjoyed our short stay at Hermina's.

The location is perfect with only 5 minutes away to the subway and then it is only 15 minutes to go downtown Boston. 
"
77691,4532479,2013-05-11,5694468,Khai Ren (Adrian),Hermina is friendly and nice host! Her house is really near to the train station which makes it very convenient. Her house is cozy and comfy. My overall experience is positive!
77691,4664315,2013-05-19,1778764,John,Hermina is a very kind person who makes you feels welcome in her home. We had some interesting chats about our various travels. Her place is very close to metro station which is only a few stops from downtown area. Nice place to stay. Thanks Hermina
77691,4859758,2013-05-29,5056934,Ulrich,"We (three adults) stay in Hermina's appartment B, she is a friendly and nice host!. The instructions were clear and the place was comfortable. Great stay! Her place is very close to metro station which is only a few stops from downtown area. Parking in no problem. It is pleasant to talk with Hermina."
77691,4907577,2013-06-01,6141946,Ped,Hermina was great. Instructions were clear and the place was clean and comfortable. Great stay!

77691,5016723,2013-06-07,4055268,Jordan,"Very nice place! Proximity to police station is extremely comforting and the house is a VERY short walk to the 'T' trains. We were able to leave the car parked near the house while we bounced between downtown, the harbor, Harvard, and Fenway. So convenient and safe that the price was such a steal! Hermina is great and I would recommend this to anyone on a tight budget :)"
77691,5154300,2013-06-15,3063553,Reynard & Irene,Nice and pretty convenient place as it's just 3 mins away from train station.
77691,5254377,2013-06-20,6905102,Eric,"People from local Boston claimed that we were in a bad location, but that wasn't the case at all! We ate good cheap oriental food in the neighborhood, and everyone we passed by was friendly! The T is so close and takes you right into the city in minutes. It's great! Parking was free which is a plus, and we really enjoyed our room. We had a very pleasant stay."
77691,5471908,2013-07-01,5848234,Rodolfo,"We did not get to stay due to inability to communicate at the last minute.  Before that, all communication was expedient and Hermina was very gracious to refund a large portion of our fee. Property description mostly accurate but be careful of high expectations."
77691,5734661,2013-07-14,6769919,Cindy,"Hermina made us feel very welcome, the room was spacious, and the location worked out well with our plans around the city.  We were very happy with the experience overall."
77691,5864488,2013-07-20,6655586,Louis,"Very nice house in a practical area (minutes from T station). Bedroom and other living rooms are clean and pleasant, many amenities available (clothes washing, iron, fridge...). Hermina is a nice person, eager to bring flexibility as much as possible when needed (check-in/out).
For sure recommended !!
"
77691,5901260,2013-07-21,1135361,Brona,"The house is super easy to get to, very close to the metro. Hermina is lovely, she made me coffee and gave me a nice pastry in the morning. The room was nice and large. Overall good experience!"
77691,5998011,2013-07-25,7341681,Paul And Gloria,We were delayed in our arrival due to weather but Hermina was very accommodating. We only stayed one night on our way down to the cape. But it was close and comfortable. She recommended a nice Vietnamese place for a late dinner.  Just what we needed.
77691,6051145,2013-07-28,7063270,Hsun-Chih,nice room
77691,6133554,2013-07-31,2837565,Adam,"Did not get to meet host as she was out of town, but she did provide us with people to contact in Boston if needed. Instructions to house were good and got into house OK. We were not told which room we would be staying in - as there are several that she lets out - and had to contact host's friend. When we found our room the door was locked and there was someone asleep in our bed! We arrived after 1pm (which Hermina told us was the check in time) to be told by the woman in our bed that Hermina had said she could have the room until 5pm as she had just worked a night shift!! The lady kindly let us leave our massive backpacks in the room but we had to take all valuables with us. We were not informed of this by the host. 

When we came back later that evening, the room had been vacated. The room was nice and spacious and the bed was comfortable, although there was a random mattress leaned up against one of the walls. 

We were then woken up at 1.30am by two of the other guests washing and drying their clothes in the machine. As the bathroom - which is where the machines are located - was right next to our room, the noise was extremely loud and we had a lousy night's sleep. I spoke to the girls who apologised, but then kept going!! 

Even though the house is next to a police station we did not feel 100% comfortable coming back to the house in the dark because of the neighbourhood and so came home early. 

Hermina clearly uses her house as some sort of hostel. We were not expecting this. The sheets and towels were thin and there were dirty sheets on the landing and in the front room. Would not stay here again. "
77691,6267552,2013-08-05,3619064,Matthias,"Hermina is a very nice and helpful host  and quick answering any questions. Her place is conveniently located, has a nice personal touch and all the amenities you would even expect from a b&b."
77691,6359259,2013-08-09,5370059,David,"My daughter and I stayed at Hermina's home while she was away on vacation.  Except for a young group of inconsiderate people that came in after midnight and all took showers, our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.  I believe Hermina would have been able to take appropriate action if she was home.  Her assistant Christina responded to my text after midnight and was willing to come over and speak to the young group, but I decided to wait it out.  Overall everything went well and we felt at ease in Hermina's clean, comfortable home and would stay again."
77691,6442727,2013-08-12,7207361,Willow,This was an excellent place to stay. The room was spacious and comfortable. Excellent water pressure and temperature in the shower. Near the subway. Plenty of street parking. It was also great to have access to a refrigerator.
77691,6619465,2013-08-19,1432300,Beth,"We reserved two rooms, but only one was available when we arrived, due to various levels of confusion and miscommunication.  Hermina did the right thing by issuing a partial refund, which I appreciated, given the annoyance of crowding everyone into one room.  The house is very clean and nice.  The neighborhood is a lower income area of Boston, which new visitors to the area might want to be aware of.  We were perfectly comfortable walking around, plus there is a police station right next door."
77691,6873184,2013-08-28,7637561,Benjamin,"We arrived around 11 pm in South Station, Boston and easily took the T Red Line to Ashmont and walked five minutes to Hermina's house. We found an attractive apartment with the key waiting for us. We slept well and were off early the next morning. Great stay even though we didn't actually meet Hermina, whose schedule didn't coincide with ours.

"
77691,6909226,2013-08-29,7302053,Bart,"Good value for money. Location is OK; it will take you about 15 minutes to get downtown ($ 2,50 by subway) Hermina is a nice and interested person."
77691,6972713,2013-09-01,8292219,Emilia,"Hermina was a great host, her house is comfortable (extra nice to have the police station next door) and very close to the T, which makes it really convenient to get into Boston. I would stay here again. Thanks Hermina!"
77691,7483043,2013-09-22,7184086,Abby,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Boston in beautiful and the house location was convenient to downtown. Hermina was very kind and always help us quickly if we had any questions. We stayed on the second floor of the house and shared a bathroom with 3 other rooms with multiple people in each room, so there were definitely days where we needed to wait to have access with the restroom. Some nights got a little noisy if there were a lot of guests staying at one time.  It is a 5 minute walk to the train and bus stop, less than 15 minutes on the train to downtown where we could transfer if needed. 30 minute train ride to Harvard if you are going that way. We tried to get back to the house before 8 or 9pm because the neighborhood did not seem the most safe, but we never had any trouble. We liked eating at the Vietnamese place close by and there were couple very small convenience stores and a dollar store close by as well. All in all a good deal for a big city like Boston."
77691,7551987,2013-09-24,7859099,Quest,"Hermina is absolutely a wonderful person and always quick to help if needed. Donna, her housekeeper, is also really sweet. This place is really close to the metro."

77691,8143057,2013-10-17,9311242,Andreas,"We staid two nights at Herminas house. We had a good time, Hermina had a good understanding of our need for privacy, and she was very helpful when needed. The location is very convenient - close to T-train, beach, grocery etc. Thanks for a good stay."
77691,8158340,2013-10-18,5171990,Bruce,"Clean home, good communication and very diverse guests! Host gracious and communicated needs well. Would stay again."
77691,8230859,2013-10-21,9245503,Laszlo,This was my first time using the service for a week end stay in Boston. The location is excellent just a five minute walk from the T on the line that takes you to thr universities in Cambridge and downtown. The bed was comfortable parking was easy and Ms. Hermina was very helpful.

77691,8571859,2013-11-05,5506364,Yadi,"Really enjoyed staying here. It felt like a home. The bed was comfortable and the house was quiet given that there were several guests staying here. Couldn't really make breakfast as I had a hard time finding the oil and there was no milk, but there is a McDonalds very close by. They do have tea and coffee readily available and keep candy and nuts and other munchies the guests might need. They provide towels and the house is always warm. The metro station is very very close by and I felt safe and cozy. Thank you so much for everything Hermina. "
77691,8775193,2013-11-17,8730646,Luozhou,"It is very nice, clean place to stay in! The room is private with a queen-size bed. And the room is pretty large with a desk. Donna is also very helpful! They offer food, such as bananas, muffins, oatmeal, milk, and orange juice!"
77691,8852386,2013-11-21,9855179,Albert,Hermina's home is a wonderful welcoming space. She is out of the country currently but Donna is available for any needs. The neighborhood is safe. Great location close to the subway.

Hermina was a gracious host as well.  I'm very grateful for the way she accommodated my awkward schedule.

I'd definitely stay with her if I return to Boston and would have no problems recommending it to others.

77691,11436346,2014-04-02,7429414,Tanvi,"Great host. Great house, very well connected to go anywhere in Boston."
77691,11765568,2014-04-14,764375,Johnathan,"This is an EXCELLENT place to stay if you're looking to be in Boston for any amount of time. I was staying the weekend for PAX EAST 2014, and this location is so convenient and affordable! I could have paid 900 dollars for hotels for 3 nights, but this was only a FRACTION of the cost!

The house itself is BEAUTIFUL and spacious. The location is perfect. It's right around the block from the Fields Corner Red Line station. On the way, you'll see all sorts of restaurants and a quaint little park. The neighborhood is safe and secure. 

The house is also clean, as Hermina has a personal assistant who stops by the house every day to work and make sure that things are in order. Top notch service! Even if you never see anybody else, you'll have directions for things posted all over the place. The space has access to a living room with cable tv, a full kitchen, with everything from a fridge to a rice cooker... it's just the best. 

There's even a guest book near the front door. You can see that throughout the years Hermina has had literally hundreds of pleased visitors who were so thankful for her excellent hospitality. 

Five stars aren't enough! "

77691,14648011,2014-06-23,16592984,Alexis,"The room was clean, and as pictured. The house is conveniently located near the T stop. Hermina was out of the country and our only contact with her was via email but she was very courteous. There was a bit of a snafu the first morning we were there because the keys that were left for our room did not actually work our door, and it took a little over an hour to get in touch with the person who manages the house when Hermina isn't there. Once this was straightened out our stay was enjoyable. "
77691,14762978,2014-06-25,1443858,Antoine,"Very nice stay, convenient and clean :) Loved my time in Dorchester thanks to Hermina !!"
77691,15238684,2014-07-05,17167170,Sara,"Great accommodations, good location. Very enjoyable stay."
77691,15366375,2014-07-07,17382346,Siyu,I visited Boston on my own and stayed in Hermina's house for two nights. It was very cozy and beautiful! The neighbourhood is quiet and the house not very far away from the Metro station. 
77691,15854575,2014-07-16,18089863,Madlin,"Thanks for an easy and comfortable stay! Though we didn't see Hermina and missed the moment to speak to Donna the contact and answers we're very quick, helpful and kind. The neighboorhood was quiet and serveral supermarkets are right behind the corner. We felt very welcomed and had a pleasent stay! Next time in Boston we'll come back!"
77691,16647357,2014-07-30,14414928,Silvia,"Highly recommended accommodation 15 minutes by metro from downtown Boston!
The house is big but cozy and quaint.
There are lots of bedrooms but we hardly met the other guests, so privacy is kept.
Our room was huge, light, clean and nicely furnished and so it's the whole house.
The kitchen is very well equipped and some basic ingredients for breakfast are provided.
The host does not (always) live there, so we recommend not arriving too late at night for the check-in.
Metro station and shopping mall are 5 minutes walking distance but are not very recommendable places to hang around, especially at night.

We loved staying at Herminia's, thank you!!!"
77691,16745051,2014-08-01,14688439,Lauren,"Overall, we had an average experience. Donna, the woman who takes care of the house was more than helpful the entire time. Somehow, there was a mix up with bookings and we were unable to check in to our room because someone had decided to stay an extra night. Donna quickly got us into another room and even moved our luggage to the room we were supposed to be in the next day. The only other problem we had was a little mouse who ate a bit of some bread that we had in a shopping bag in our room. Donna told us that she was already handling that problem and it should be fixed soon."
77691,16815168,2014-08-02,189584,Richard,"Nice room, great proximity to the T.  The only downside is 2 bathrooms shared by about 5 sets of guests.  "
77691,17102372,2014-08-07,17105107,Clara,"Very nice place situated in Dorchester, really next to Boston. The house is big, luminous, the room B that I occupied with my mother was large and comfortable.
Hermina's help, Donna, was there when we arrived and she explained us our room and the rules of the house.
We had everything for breakfast, fruits, cereals, jam, coffee, tea ... 

The location of the house is very convenient because the ""T"", the Boston metro, is at 5min walk. Within a few minutes, we are in the center of Boston.
Careful though, the neighborhood is fine by day but at night, don't hang around.

Finally, we had a wonderful stay in Hermina's house and we definitely recommend it.
"
77691,17188064,2014-08-08,15230345,Heather,"Nice place to stay for the price. It was a little far from the airport with all our luggage so it cost about $80 to get there & back with a taxi.  If you're able to take the train though, it seems like an easy route as the instructions from host are very clear. The area felt safe, it was right next to police station. "
77691,18045435,2014-08-20,6409759,Sushrutha,"We had a very nice stay at Hermine's place. The place looked exactly like in pictures. Every small detail was taken care of including towels, access key, internet code, breakfast etc. Though we did not meet Dona (house in charge) during our stay, she helped us a lot over phone including telling us where to park and sharing pictures to ensure parking is fine.

Cleanliness: The house was very clean and tastefully decorated
Neighborhood: Even though house is minutes away from subway, we did not  always feel very comfortable walking home during late hours

"
77691,18133246,2014-08-22,114538,Gerardo,"Stay all the time, its always great"
77691,18351867,2014-08-25,19656976,Brenda,"The place was clean and confortable. I dont have any complaint to do. Even we did not see Sra Hermina, everything was ready to us. I really recommend you."
77691,18574935,2014-08-28,19638382,Emily,"It was very nice being able to stay at Hermina's place.  She wasn't there, but we knew that in advance, and that was ok.  The room was ready and clean and everything was organized.  The house has, I think, 6 separate rooms for guests, and we ran into several other guests in the common areas at various times -- all really nice people.  (by the way, no air-con, but we were ok with the ceiling fan and a small fan in the window...)

Dorchester has not-the-greatest reputation and the neighborhood could make someone nervous, but we felt fine at the house itself (next to the police station and across from a Buddhist center.)

The only ""negative"" was that breakfast supplies get set out the day before in the kitchen by Hermina's friend Donna (we didn't meet her but had contact via text message.)  Apparently the food and coffee she had set out prior to our arrival was almost completely consumed by the various guests before the morning of our first breakfast.  (no milk, no bread, no fruit, no coffee, no yogurt, no juice...)  That was kind of a drag.  It was great that the kitchen was available for everyone and that there were spices and condiments and basic ingredients there.  And I can understand that having a stock of 10 cans of coffee in the cupboard would be an invitation for people to take a can with them... but there ought to be some way to ""budget"" breakfast items so that they don't run out.  Anyway, tip to future guests: scope out the kitchen when you arrive and contact Donna immediately if supplies are low.  Or plan to eat out in the morning.  

Even if there was no breakfast included, this would be a great place to stay... as long as you are aware of the situation...  We would definitely recommend."
77691,18610081,2014-08-28,10776001,Martín,"The house and the room were very nicely decorated. The room was spacious. One thing that made me uncomfortable was the requirement not to wear shoes in the house. One should at least be able to wear flip flops, which wouldn't damage the floors. The house seems to function like a self-regulated guest house, and not like a private residence. I would have liked to know this in advance, or that this had been made explicit in the ad."
77691,18761677,2014-08-31,20235045,Michael,"Well decorated, clean, well stocked kitchen, our first time, we were delighted, happy to stay there again.  Pre arrival email communication was detailed, accurate, host was responsive answering our questions."
77691,18958422,2014-09-03,1104388,Gwladys,"We've been hosted by Hermina and Donna for 3 nights. It was our first in time in Boston. The house is close to the station (Fields corner) which is good and it is located next to a kind of police warehouse. Sometimes you will hear the alarm, it is very disturbing, I remember that a sunday morning the alarm didn't stop to ring.
We were located in room B. When we arrived nobody was there to welcome us. We knew Hermina was out of the country and Donna the house-keeper but we didn't have the chance to meet her during our all stay in Hermina's house. We didn't have a very good experience unfortunately. When we arrived room was not clean  (however we knew it, we arrived in the morning around 10.00 am) and bathroom as well (hairs were on the washstand and bathroom, it was not very pleasant to take a shower). The first day, we had to leave the door of our room unlocked  for Donna to come and clean the room. When we came back from our first day, we couldn’t find our luggage in the room, we were very frightened! We found them in the living room (Donna probably moved them…). The same night, we were awakened by the sound of a mouse ! The mouse was eating some chips located on the table. We informed Hermina by Email and she answered very quickly and give us instructions. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable. However our first impression was not really positive. It was too bad we didn’t meet Donna, we saw a few guests but that’s all. When we made the reservation through the website, we had some troubles getting concrete answers from Hermina, it was like she didn’t really take the time to read and answer properly to our questions. We had to chase her to get our answers. We insisted because we really wanted to make our reservation with her because of the good comments. Once the reservation is confirmed, she sends long instructions which is good but it is also a pity she doesn't really take the time to personnalize messages. We really enjoyed Boston, we will come back for sure but we will have to choose another place to stay and sleep unfortunately.  "
77691,19290988,2014-09-09,14325032,Clémence,"La nuit s'est bien passée. Appartement très bien situé, chambre agréable. Hermina s'est montrée très disponible pour répondre à nos questions et organiser notre venue."
77691,20030879,2014-09-22,20452541,Hope,"Perfect memorize. 离地铁站很近,附近吃的也比较方便,关键是家里真的很美,给自己的旅程增加了更美的回忆。"
77691,20219394,2014-09-25,21641242,J.T.,"It's a good house to stay.  It's also very close to the subway. It's so convenient for us to travel around and the environment around the house is quiet at night.  The house is clean, and comfortable.  I really recommend this house."
77691,20697921,2014-10-04,18787965,Liu,"英文
The room was clean and comfortable, convenient traffic around, Donna is very  friendly. We spent a pleasant evening."
77691,20981252,2014-10-08,6465392,Varsha,"We made a last minute reservation and were initially skeptical about the neighborhood after hearing from friends, but we had no other option so booked it anyway and I am glad we did. We arrived late at night and found someone else in our room, but hermina was quick to sort it out. The room is very clean, spacious and comfortable with a shared bathroom next door. I appreciate the fact that Hermina provides everything (not the case for many Airbnbs): washing machine, dryer, bath products, breakfast, fresh towels, heater etc. It is a fantastic deal also because it is only a few minutes away from the station. There are a few eateries nearby too. Just a note: you can hear street sounds at night so maybe not the best if you are a light sleeper. Didn't bother us at all. Also the stairs to the room are a bit steep so consider that if you need to. Otherwise this was the perfect place and I would definitely stay again. "
77691,21064257,2014-10-10,22195044,Irene,"My host Hermina,  met me at the door.  She showed me where to park and parking was easily available.
I stayed in an area separate from the main house, right around the side.  This was to allow me to bring my bike into the house.  This space was clean and neat, though not Victorian.   My bedroom was welcoming and the bed comfortable.  I had a good nights sleep.  The bathroom, shared was clean and convenient.  There was a very lively couple there who shared that floor with me.  All good."
77691,21369678,2014-10-15,1395613,Konni,"The house is very nice, big and spacious so I felt good there. Had some good conversation with Hermina. The neighborhood is nothing special maybe but the train stop is close by and quick access to the city."
77691,21980881,2014-10-27,3779793,Júlia,"Fue muy sencillo encontrar la casa con las indicaciones de Herminia, está muy cerca del metro y llegar al centro de la ciudad es rápido. Donna, lo mejor de la estancia!  es muy amable y nos resolvió todas las dudas. La habitación es igual que en las imágenes, amplia y limpia. El único problema es que se escuchan bastante los ruidos de los demás inquilinos de la casa.
Se puede usar la cocina y por la mañana Donna nos invitó a desayunar con café, fruta fresca y pan. Muy recomendable para quedarse en Boston! "
77691,22596783,2014-11-10,22341898,Shogo,It's nice atmosphere. Thank you!
77691,22723954,2014-11-12,7637561,Benjamin,"This is the second time I have stayed with Hermina. Her home is tidy and accomodating, and she handles everything kindly and professionally. The place is in excellent condition, less than five minutes walk from a metro station and therefore quite easily accessible from downtown Boston."
77691,22940916,2014-11-17,3925607,Shane,"This is a great deal and comfortable place to stay. Hermina is a wonderful host and was very responsive on short notice. This home is close to a Red Line train station- only a few blocks away, which made it convenient and easy to get around. 
I will be back next time I'm in Boston. 

"
77691,23551896,2014-12-04,18854380,Holger,"It is very easy to describe my feelings. Hermina is a courteous and helpful hostess. The room are spacious and in the kitchen I could work like in my own apartment. 

But I have to mention her commitment on my departure day as there were a problem with my rental car. It was towed. She supported  me and did many telephone calls. Without her support, it would have been difficult for me to get the car back right in time, because I was on the way to the airport.

Once again many thanks to her support, it is certainly not self-evident.

Best regards, Holger"
77691,32716088,2015-05-20,32747327,Cheri,We had a great experience. The house and room were extremely clean and Hermina was able to accommodate our timing needs. Have already scheduled a return visit.
77691,32928240,2015-05-23,30643420,Christos,"INsgesamt sehr schöne Unterkunft und ein geräumiges Zimmer, dass nicht nur mit dem Nötigsten ausgestattet ist. Die Küche kann man tatsächlich sinnvoll nutzen, falls man das möchte, da Dinge wie Öl oder Gewürze, die man nicht unbedingt für einmal Kochen kaufen möchte, vorhanden sind. Wärmstens weiterzuempfehlen."
77691,33307812,2015-05-26,33150574,Huiting,"非常好的入住体验,房子如描述的一样,很漂亮,房间干净舒适并且宽敞。离地铁很近,非常方便。总之,住在这里本身就是旅行中一次绝佳的体验。"
77691,34557867,2015-06-09,32738410,Barbara,"The house was really beautiful and my room  was quite spacious, with everything I could have needed, and the possibility to use the kitchen for breakfast was definitely a plus. Hermina was really great - she sent me detailed directions on howe to get there and as soon as I arrived she welcomed me, helped me with my stuff, and we enjoyed a cup of tea and a lovely chat together, joined by one of the other guests as well. She gave me pointers on what to see during my stay in Boston and always had a kind word when we saw each other, and on my last day she even drove me to the bus station on her way to the shops. If I ever go to Boston again I'm definitely booking with her."
77691,34745754,2015-06-11,35011300,Longfei, This is a good place to stay. And it's quiet and clean room. Clean restroom. The place is very close to subway station so that you can go to any places in Boston very quickly.
77691,35484502,2015-06-19,33631837,Afsoon,"Hermina was a great host, the room was clean and all information was complete and accurate. She bought a cake for my 5 years old daughter's birthday that surprised her a lot!! Also lots of shopping centers are nearby. The T-line is really close, and everything in the house just looked like the pictures. I recommend this place to you. Thank you a lot Hermina..."
77691,35867142,2015-06-22,27018868,Jennifer,"We did not get a chance to meet Hermina, but she was easily reached online before and during our trip. There was a minor miscommunication (we hadn't received the code to enter the house beforehand), but everything was sorted after a phone call, which she answered immediately. The room was clean, and the bed was comfy. The house is also conveniently located near the subway. Hermina also allowed us to leave the luggage in the house after checkout time, which was a huge help!  "
77691,36463420,2015-06-28,36213036,Scott,"We came to Boston from the west coast, and stayed at Hermina's place for three evenings.
We were uncertain in our arrival times and etc, but she was warm and welcoming, and gave us via text and email, all of the information we needed to arrive  whenever.

The room was clean and quiet as was the bathroom. Its's safe, the Boston Police Headquarters is a block away. We used both a car as well as the T, and found both easy to manage.
There were not a lot of local breakfast, lunch-type places, but we did not spend much time in Dorchester anyway.
If you seek a simple, quiet, clean place to sleep, I think this is a good choice. Its not fancy, but it is quiet and comfortable."
77691,37619359,2015-07-08,5577384,Helene,Hermina was nice and gave all the necessary information to reach her place. Unfortunately I had to cancel but she was very professional. 
77691,37720328,2015-07-09,36996005,Theo,"Hermina was very quick with her replies, and made it easy to find and access the house. Once there, it appeared she rents multiple rooms, each designated with its own letter (A-D I believe). A door with a key code provides access even when she's not  at home to receive her guests. We shared a little bathroom with two other rooms. Although fully functional, the bathroom has visibly served for quite some years. Location is 5 minutes from the subway, which takes you to the city center in about 10-15 minutes I believe. Bedroom B itself was clean and the bed was ok, no AC but it did have a ceiling fan."
77691,37823096,2015-07-10,27751597,Falgun,"Hermina was very kind, professional. I stayed one night at her place. She gave a good overview on her property. Showed me where the essentials are that I need. I will most certainly stay at hers if i have to.
Internet speed was nice in block H."

77691,38028323,2015-07-12,36693827,Xin,Good experience!Good house.Easy transportation.
77691,38212117,2015-07-13,18112725,Jessica,"Hermina was very easy to communicate with and was always quick to respond to my messages.  My husband and I arrived from the airport in the evening and I was worried about not having an exact arrival time for Hermina as it was my first time flying into Boston Logan and taking public trans.  However, Hermina was very kind and let us know that whenever we got in was fine.  I've found that not all Airbnb hosts are that flexible with arrival time!  

She left us detailed directions on how to get to the house from the airport so transportation there was much easier than I think it could have otherwise been!  The house is about a five minute walk from the T station.  The walk from the T station was a bit sketchy, so I wouldn't arrive late at night as a single female or cart around a ton of luggage.  I was with my husband, though, so I was fine.

The house is beautiful and looks like the photos that Hermina has displayed.  I loved walking into a Victorian home!  You can tell she takes a lot of pride in her place and makes it nice for travelers.  My room was already pretty cool when I arrived, which was great on a hot and humid summer day!  I appreciated the desk, closet, and dressers to unpack in.  I used the shower to clean up after a full day of travel.  The water pressure was good.  It is a shared bathroom between I think two or three rooms, so be aware that you may need to be flexible.  There are some stores just a few minutes from the hosue, which is convenient.  Unfortunately, we didn't end up staying the night because my sister-in-law's plans changed and she was able to have me stay at her house.  Hermina was understanding, and, even though we didn't meet in person, I know she is kind and wants her guests to have the best experience possible.  "
77691,38362007,2015-07-14,38050846,Yansong,"Overall the experience was good. Hermina was responsive and friendly. But the area was noisy, and air conditioning was not available."
77691,38468422,2015-07-15,8571852,Nicole,The room was very clean and the house is very near to the subway as it takes a short 5min walk :) glad that we could find this place at the very last minute and thank you for the stay!
77691,38570147,2015-07-16,38352836,Piper,"Every thing was perfect, great place, neighborhood and hostess was very accommodating.  Easy public transit and 5 minutes off the highway. great for 1-2 people"

77691,39572551,2015-07-24,4675129,Kate,"I thought this was a great place. Really comfortable and convenient and clean, and Hermina was very kind and accommodating. I would definitely recommend it. "
77691,40511422,2015-07-31,31511478,Xiaodong,"Hermina的房子在Dorchester的中心,离红线地铁,购物等十分方便。房子整洁温馨,房子后院挨着警察局,让人觉得很安全,车子泊在路边三天,没出现任何问题。房子的设施很齐全,除了没有空调这唯一的遗憾外,我们全家都很享受在这里的三个晚上。Wish everything wil be all right with Hermina and her house."
77691,40977244,2015-08-03,18330959,Andrea,"What can I say everything was perfect and clear. Hermina let us leave our bags earlier than the check in time and even after the check out time. I really appreciated that , the room was big and nice. I'm happy with my stay in her house. "

77691,42063600,2015-08-10,33845706,Sheena,"Good location, easy to find. Pretty house with big space in the room B. Mattress and comforter are really comfortable. There were plenty of food (toast, milk...etc) in the kitchen on the night we arrived, but we probably woke up late because in the morning most of them were gone. So if you expect to have a hearty breakfast, wake up early. Generally speaking, this is a great place to stay in Boston. Definitely recommended."
77691,45174985,2015-08-31,41852774,宇,"This room is so nice that we have spent a very good night and contributes a lot to our two-day trip in Boston. With a police department nearby, it is very safe, and many supermarkets and restaurants are less than 5 minutes walk, you don't need to worry your breakfast at all. Strongly Recommend. Hope to visit again soon. "
77691,47796155,2015-09-21,42788932,Kim,"Hermina was a very gracious and helpful hostess. She was always making something that smelled yummy in the kitchen and always willing to share a sample. Everything was clean and well kept. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

The path was very convenient and easy to get where I needed to go.

The home was always busy with different guests and it was fun to meet different people from different states and countries. "
77691,48236687,2015-09-24,44381911,Seth,"Hermina is a very nice lady that welcomed us in her house. The house is very nearby the trainstop Fields Corner. Fields Corner is according to Hermina a safe neighbourhood but we had our doubts, didn't feel very safe after sunset.  
The room was very big and next to the bathroom ( which Hermina kept very clean). 
In the morning Hermina offered some apples from her garden so I could make a fresh applejuice. Besides that we could eat from her bread, cream cheese and jams. 
We felt very welcome!"

77691,51451847,2015-10-20,43300859,Rindy,"My friend and I visited Boston for the first time this past weekend. Hermina has a very beautiful home in Dorchester (South Boston). It was absolutely perfect for our needs. We had a very nice room, nice small amenities, a fridge to store our food and we could also cook. Hermina's home is in the most PERFECT location. It's a VERY short walk to the T-Line. As first-timers, my friend and I navigated our way very easily throughout Boston and even to Salem. There are many local bakeries, restaurants, pubs/bars within walking distance of Hermina's home and all of a great variety. Thank you so much, Hermina, for hosting us! It was an amazing trip of a lifetime and we can't wait to go back to Boston!! -With Love from Arkansas "
77691,52064603,2015-10-26,27561823,Patricia,Entrance instructions were easy to follow. Hermina was out of town so we did not meet her. She did send an email asking if we had arrived. The second floor bedroom was large and spacious. Bed was very comfortable.  Two chairs and a mirror in the room. Not easy sharing one shower with five rental units. Kitchen was welcoming. Very close to the T station on the red line which goes directly to Cambridge. No problem finding parking on her street.
77691,52303591,2015-10-27,673334,Liana,"Overall: met our needs and was a comfortable and clean stay; I didn't feel it was the best value but my BF thought it was great. Read below for details and decide for yourself:)

Best parts: bed was great (firm-ish, king size in room 2B); room was clean and comfortable overall; did not meet host but she was communicative and helped with parking. Parking was readily available, especially by Boston standards. (Just have to check signs for alternating street cleaning in the morning)

Other notes:
House is as-described as far as neighborhood goes.

bathroom was clean. One of our towels smelled slightly musty. 

Walls were thin so you can hear others on that level out in the hallway

Pictures make it look more cosy and homey than it felt in person. In person it felt a little 'cold' - that's just me though. There are little signs all over the house letting you know things which is helpful. There was also one in bedroom to ask that you not move thermostat above 68 degrees because 'heat is expensive.' - not the most welcoming 

We got there late so it was a little 'shady' walking up to the place. No lights on out front and no one to greet us. So felt like anyone could have walked in. Not a serious concern but not ideal"
77691,52467201,2015-10-29,41010583,Lindsey,"Hermina was helpful via phone. The house caretakers were also kind and helpful. The house was just like the photos. 
The neighborhood is okay. I felt safe walking to the subway after dark. Very close to public transportation, yay! 
Some waiting for the shower in the morning. As expected, more like a nice European hostel than a hotel. 
Good value for the price relative to Boston area."
77691,71383471,2016-04-25,21503402,David,"Hermina has a beautiful home and was a great host. My co-workers and I needed a place to stay for a weekend conference, and our room was spacious and cozy enough for all 3 of us. The amenities were nice, and she was great with communication. There are also plenty of stores and restaurants in the area, with street parking available around the block. We would definitely stay again. "
77691,73940749,2016-05-11,45077926,Jeremy,Hermina was kind and accommodating for my last minute stay; she even upgraded my room to a larger room which was a welcome surprise. Her home is in walking distance from the Forest Hills station for the Red line which made getting to work easy. 
77691,74724811,2016-05-16,63759007,Martin,"We had a great time at Hermina place  The house was very nice and Hermina made us really feel at home. She provided everything we needed and was very helpful when we were deciding what to see in Boston.
We can definitely recommend her and her house to anyone!"
77691,81676060,2016-06-24,50277818,Sean,"Hermina's home was great for our two days in Boston. It's very close to a Red Line train station, and the place was clean and convenient. The room was large and easily accommodated our group. It was also great value for how quickly we were able to get to downtown Boston and Cambridge, considering how expensive it can get the closer to the city center you get. Would definitely consider staying here again."
77691,82942183,2016-06-30,71796339,Jesse,This place is nice and close to all sorts of things.  Well kept and clean.  I will be staying here again in the near future.
77691,83776434,2016-07-04,40446828,Virginie,"Good emplacement, near subway, easy to find a parking with a car. Big house, but we were with some other people. Nice for meeting other people! "
77691,89637147,2016-07-29,63724988,Didier,"Hermina si really helpful and very kind. Her house is great and our bed was huge.
The neibourhood is a bit noisy at night and having no air conditionner during the heat wave, we had to sleep with the windows opened. Anyway we enjoyed our stay and the place is 15 min to town, which is good when you don t want to lose too much time on transport. "
77691,89893025,2016-07-30,85902385,Hiroko,"She was really a  friendly, kind lady. and the room was spacy, and comfortable, yes it is a pretty house.
I felt the area Dorchester a bit rough at first but it wasnt so much after all.I liked that her place is just  next to the police station ; )
It is multicutual area at the same time, you can get good Vietnamese foods in this neighbor! 
There are 3 other guests while I was staying, they are open, nice people easy to get along."
77691,90835135,2016-08-02,14077593,Lisa,Très bon séjour à Boston. La maison est à côté du métro ce qui est positif. Hermina a été très disponible. Je recommande. 
77691,91251484,2016-08-04,77968186,Elizabeth,"We never saw Hermina, but everything we needed was available and it was easy to find things like extra towels or linens. We enjoyed our stay and accommodations were nice."
77691,92037945,2016-08-07,45615536,Anita,"Room B in Hermina's place is very large and fits three guests easily. Although it was quite warm, the room was comfortable with the ceiling fan and windows on various sides. The house is well located for public transport, parking is easy. You will meet other guests but there is enough privacy. Good place for exploring Boston."
77691,92874485,2016-08-10,37354840,Manuel,"Excellent experience in Hermina's house, such a great person and really clean a comfortable house. The only thing I'd add would be an air conditioner in the bedroom but other that that, awesome house."
77691,93173720,2016-08-11,76596519,Christophe,"Quartier moyen, sans charme. Maison sans charme, chambre ultra basique, pas de clim, bruyante. A coté de la police locale, certes sécurisant, mais gyrophares et bruits de radio toutes les nuits sous la fenêtre. dommage, les photos donnaient l'impression d'une maison traditionnelle Bostonienne, on en est loin. "
77691,94145581,2016-08-14,86441208,Sophia,"Hermina was a very accommodating, kind host. However there is no A/C in the room and during our stay we made the mistake of leaving the windows open. It was extremely noisy, but after closing the windows the noise was less of an issue. I also did not feel safe walking home from the T at night."
77691,94890282,2016-08-17,70699118,Rohana,"Hermina was sweet. The location was not the best, but it was a very close walk to the Red Line so that was great. Our main problem with staying there was not at all her, it was mainly the fact that she over-books. The room was clean and beds were very comfortable. There is no AC so beware, during the summer it is quite hot upstairs (where all the bedrooms are). Our problem was that there in only 1 1/2 bathrooms in the entire house and there were several groups of airbnb people staying there, not including herself and her two young kids. It was almost impossible  to take a shower and get ready in the mornings and evenings, because as soon as one person gets out, another gets in. Her washer/dryer are also located in the main bathroom, so people are in there doing laundry while others need to shower/use the restroom. 

Her house is also right next to a Boston police station, so we could hear dispatch and cars often opening and closing. If you need quiet to fall asleep, this is not the place you want to stay. 

Overall: it was an alright experience, but I would not stay there again. It would be a much more comfortable experience if Hermina stops overbooking her place. "
77691,98943641,2016-09-02,58849274,Beatrice,The room was clean and big. The bathroom was clean as well. Hermina was very nice and welcoming. 
77691,100973871,2016-09-11,10784048,HongHao,"Close to Redline, Hermina is friendly and helpful. It takes 20 to 30 mins to the downtown."
77691,102606708,2016-09-18,26152641,Frank,"Very nice place, very convenient to metro station. Parking place is easy to find, the neighbor  is very safe, police department is just next door."
77691,103091343,2016-09-20,6262298,Lacey,Lovely stay at Hermina's!
77691,103444787,2016-09-22,18092523,Srinath,"Hermina is very flexible and friendly. I missed to book for x days and she is quite flexible to provide me the time to book.

She is also communicative to leave your lagguage upfront in case if you arrive early.

I would definitely recommend the place

77691,105681558,2016-10-02,55328445,Annie,We would recommend friends and family to come and stay here since it is close to Boston and Salem and even family in Providence RI. 
77691,107196127,2016-10-09,55328445,Annie,"The last night we were in Boston, we stayed in Room B as this was our 3rd night night from the previous weekend. Room B was nice and comfortable. She was hosting an exchange student and he welcomed us into her home and offered his hospitality. Overall the experience was great! "
77691,108280146,2016-10-15,25663970,Carmen," The bedroom as all of the house is very clean and nice. The
hostess is most friendly and considerate. She  brightened our
breakfast with Colombian music which was very pleasant and a suprise.
Thank you Hermina. Will always recommend your home.

I highly highly recommend staying here if you're looking for a place. You will NOT be disappointed. It's clean and cozy. Very genuinely satisfied with my stay here. "
77691,110186486,2016-10-24,98270337,Emily,"Hermina's place is relaxing and cozy. She provided everything we needed! The bed we had in room B was extremely comfortable, unusually comfortable. If nothing else, come for the bed. The location is truly convenient as well, a few minutes' walk to the T station. We brought a car as well and had no problem parking on the street. Thanks Hermina!"

77691,143213983,2017-04-10,21066529,Michelle,This was a good size room in a convenient location to get around by subway
77691,148414988,2017-04-30,58612904,Jeffery,"The house itself was fine. It was close to Boston which was nice. We, however, had many issues prior to arrival since Hermina tried to move us to different rooms multiple times. She did not know what room we had actually booked and how many people were coming (despite being told many times). She would tell us which room to stay in and then change it a couple hours later once that room was booked. Security was also a concern as there were keys to our personal room throughout the house. "
77691,151624611,2017-05-13,5777967,Josh,A little out of the way in a gentrifying neighborhood. My room was very clean and a cozy place to spend the night. Hermina was welcoming and made it easy for me to have a great trip to Boston
77691,152043408,2017-05-14,106130908,Roberto,Excellent place. Excellent host

77691,156684262,2017-05-31,111492324,Quyen,Hermina was very nice and welcoming and helpful in guilding us to the house. The place was very clean and close to shops and train.
77691,157783350,2017-06-04,38053832,宜寰,"It was a great experience staying here. Hermina was not at the house by the time my parents and I arrive, but with all the detailed instruction she gave us beforehand, we had no problem checking in by ourselves. The room was big and nice. It's really quiet. Their is a police parking lot near by so the safety should be pretty good. It has free street parking out side the house but you need to watch signs to make sure you're parking at the right time. The house is very close to red line train so it's convenient to travel around Boston, takes only about 20 minutes to get to the heart of Boston. I had a few chances to talk to Hermina during the stay and she is a very nice lady, easy to talk to. Highly recommended. 

Thank you Hermina for hosting us. My parents and I had a great time here."
77691,161053865,2017-06-16,5884098,Xiaolu,"The place is close to a T-station, so it is quite accessible from the airport. The room is very clean and spacious. Highly recommended."
77691,162409341,2017-06-20,1500924,Satoshi,My wife and I had a pleasant stay in her clean room. Very nice host. No complaints at all. The house is very close to a train station where you can take a train into Boston in 30min and there're plenty of parking spots around the block. Also around in a few blocks you can find a cafe/takeout restaurants/supermarket. Recommended. 
77691,164241583,2017-06-26,51510210,Logan,This place is right outside of Boston on the more quiet sidee. Parking is easy to find and ubers cost around $15-20 to downtown Boston. If the city is too expensive definitely check this place out.
77691,165364097,2017-07-01,39775138,Eric,Exactly as described. Next to the red line and cheaper than hotels. 
77691,166111852,2017-07-02,54792837,Katharine,"Our overall stay here was pleasant, and everything was accurate to the description. Parking was easy to find on the streets outside. Access to the kitchen was a nice addition. Hermina was very hospitable and kind. My boyfriend and I stayed in room B, which was right beside the bathroom. I'd like to note that there were several people staying here at the same time we were, including a family. Since the bathroom was shared amongst all of us, it was occupied much of the time. Additionally, the washing machine and dryer was located in the bathroom as well. A fellow occupant chose to do the laundry in the early morning and we were able to hear and feel the vibration of the machine spinning through our room. We also had some concerns about the safety of our belongings, as the rooms are unlocked and we were not given keys. Hermina was understanding, and reassured us that everything would be fine. While everything was fine in the end, it would have been better to have the keys since there were so many others staying here as well. "
77691,168010102,2017-07-08,130953465,Elizabeth,"Conveniently located near metro station,  bank,  coffee shop,  Vietnamese  restaurants, and grocery store. "

77691,174357708,2017-07-25,48839020,Dave,"Herminas place is less then a five minute walk to the closest subway station, which was incredibly convienient! I am so thankful I did not attempt to drive in Boston! The subway is definitely the way to go!  The cost of the seven day pass was less then one day of parking near some of the sights.  All the stops are convieniently located near the sights we were going to and from the sights we could see how driving in this city would be incredibly undesirable!

There is a restaurants and stores all within walking distance which worked out perfectly! We felt completely safe walking to the store or back from the subway station late into the night.

The house was clean, quiet, and perfectly described by the host! 
The beds were comfortable and the room we stayed in was spacious.

We parked across the road in the ""alley"" beside the Buddhist centre without issue.

Communication with the host was seamless! No issues at all!!

I would definitely recommend staying at Herminas place to anyone visiting Boston!

The host, Jack was very responsive/helpful and provided lots of suggestions to enhance my stay. The house is immaculately maintained and the bedding (including sheets) were super comfy. Already booked my future travel accommodations so I can continue to enjoy the house."
20229074,194821769,2017-09-17,42774561,David,"Fantastic hosts, beautiful home in a great location.  You cannot get a better Airbnb experience in my opinion.  Jack and Greg are the great, we loved our 4 day stay on 12 Lawrence, best we've had.  Not only was the apartment beautiful, it was clean, very modern and well appointed, they thought of everything.  The South side location was unbeatable.  Easy walk to everything in and around Boston with a 4 minute walk to the T stop.  The neighborhood offered many different restaurants, coffee shops and a Whole Foods.  I'm very picky about ambient noise and this place was quiet at night and felt very tranquil all day.  Was easy to sleep in and want to simply lounge around the apartment all day.  Frankly, I couldn't more highly recommend Jack and Greg and this location.

Fresh flowers arranged within home and seasonal decor make this charming home and location even more special. Gracious, accommodating, and tentative when needed - the hosts are stewards for the city and area."

We use the kitchen, with all the necessary equipment to cook including meals more time consuming. The house has a very nice patio! The location is perfect, steps away from Back Bay Statio and the best attractions in Boston. The only caveat is the stairs, 3 steps at the entrance of the house and a bid between the bedroom and the living room / kitchen. People with difficulties of locomotion can have difficulty! For us, it was no problem! Jack and Greg, thank you!"

Nous vous recommandons ce lieux pour loger sur boston !!!

Carney family is really friendly. The neighbordhood is nice, safe and close to the metro station. The house is beautiful. Special remark: the bathrooms are new, clean and high level of comfort.
The breakfast is very good (cake baked by the owner).

We recommend this place to sleep at Boston !!!"

We were honestly a little hesitant at first staying at a stranger's home, but the Carney family was very hospitable. They welcomed us with open arms and immediately put our fears to rest. We had a lovely stay at the Carney home. The bedroom was super clean, they provided clean towels and sheets, a safe in the closet for our valuables, coffee/water/snacks for us, and even a ride back to the airport! They're renovating their home so the bathrooms were new and beautiful. Overall, Jared and I had a great stay! Thank you, Barney and Mary!"

Juste parfait !!!

1544702,8178611,2013-10-19,9294551,Kenneth,"Enjoyed very much. Warning don't pick a third floor room if you don't like steps. The first two floors have 12 foot ceilings. It like going to the fourth floor in most places. Otherwise it was great. The two nice bathrooms on third floor are shared. They are new and  good size. The house is old. I believe I was told 160 years. It has the original wide board floors, old woodwork and ten foot high doors. The Carney family and the house is what makes this an  interesting place to stay. We found getting around Boston on the transit system easy, It about a ten minute walk. If we return to Boston we would hope to stay with the Carneys. We would request the first floor as we are in our mid 70's. If I was 20 years younger I would ask for the third floor."
1544702,8326728,2013-10-26,8053346,Andrea,"I know rave reviews can be suspicious, but quite honestly my experience in Boston was just AMAZING, and the Carneys and their home were a huge part of it. The room was amazing and clean, the family is warm and kind, and the city itself is a delight to visit. I would recommend staying at the Carneys' to ANYONE. You won't regret it: the metro is really close by (10 mins walking), the rooms are clean and beautiful, there is always food in the fridge and listening to John and Robert play just makes the experience more unbelievable. Thank you so much, Carney family!"
1544702,8432863,2013-10-30,3016635,Lucie,"The perfect ""home away from home""! 
We had a great stay at Carney's endearing and inviting home. It is situated in a lovely neighbourhood, within a short walk from the Red Line train which takes you directly to the heart of Boston. The room was clean, comfortable and exactly as described/shown in the pics. Both Mary and Barney were very welcoming and we really couldn't ask for more. We would definitely recommend this place to everyone travelling to Boston. "
1544702,8509680,2013-11-03,8692455,Caleb,"This was my 3rd time renting a room through Airbnb, the 1st time renting one while traveling alone and the 1st time staying with hosts.  The Carney family (Barney, Mary and their son Robert) were welcoming, warm and kind people and their big charming house is a short stroll from the T station.  My room was cozy and spacious and the coffee and muffins they served every morning were delicious.  I went to Boston hoping to watch a World Series game. The reason I can call this trip perfect is not only because I scored a face value ticket for game 6 but also because of my delightful stay with the Carneys!!  They are very considerate and always made sure I was comfortable and felt at home.  I recommend their house to anyone and hope to see them again, next time with my husband. :)

Thanks very much again, Barney, Mary and Robert!!
"
1544702,8586706,2013-11-06,9090629,Caleb,"Excellent room with very accommodating owners. I was very pleased with the recently refurbished bedrooms and bathrooms and breakfast was simple but good (oatmeal, muffins, toast, etc.) They also provided excellent recommendations for restaurants in the area. I would thoroughly recommend them!"
1544702,8736500,2013-11-14,3692597,Bobi,"Great people, very good location, nice house! Thanks for having me!!!"
1544702,8823514,2013-11-19,8637445,John,"A really great spot in a cute neighborhood and great value.. The rooms were simple but clean and new.Three rooms share 2 very large, nice new bathrooms. The Carney's were great hosts. Clean linens, bathrobes, and a light breakfast served in the hallway just outside the rooms. I was attending a conference at the convention center and the total time door to door was about 35 minutes via the T. There was good breakfast place and a restaurant/tavern a 10 minute walk from the house next to the T station."
1544702,8913951,2013-11-25,9964663,Randy,"The Carneys are a wonderful host family, their home is conveniently located an easy 10 minute walk to the T. The room I stayed in was extremely comfortable and highly preferable to some anonymous hotel room! I enjoyed the conversations with the Carneys and I'm thankful for the use of their crutches after I sprained my ankle on the streets of Cambridge. Oh, and the fresh muffins were a treat!

Having to leave at 4:00AM for Logan did not allow time to say goodbye, but I am very pleased with my experience. I look forward to staying again when my travels bring me to Boston!"
1544702,8933442,2013-11-26,9699264,Icy,"The place was super great!! Easy to get the metro, quiet neighborhood, nice bed, clean bathroom well equipped, and fresh fruits and snacks are also provided. Mary and her husband were so nice! They help us to find the local seafood restaurant and also recommend some places to visit. I will definitely recommend their house to my friend if they have the chance to visit Boston! "
1544702,9075039,2013-12-04,10226367,Vida,The Carney family made me feel like I was a part of their family! Wonderful experience over Thanksgiving holiday. I met their family and was even invited out to dinner with them.
1544702,11290160,2014-03-28,11559749,Ralitsa,My friend and I had a great stay at the Carney's house. Mary and Barney were very nice and welcoming. The house is beautiful and very clean. 
1544702,11329352,2014-03-30,8313319,Lee,"Excellent, charming old house made for a great 2-night stay for my friend Jonathan and me.  The bathrooms were so nice with all new and modern fixtures, as well as luxury bath products for their guests to use!  Very safe and convenient neighborhood.  Only 20 minutes from/to Downtown Boston!  Barney and Mary were very nice and accommodating.  Thanks for a great weekend!"
1544702,11596524,2014-04-08,8671041,Mios,"Barney y Mary fueron muy buenos anfitriones. Muy acogedores y de agradable conversacion, lo que facilita que te sientas como en casa. Nuestra estancia fue muy buena. Recomendamos este lugar si quereis visitar Boston. La casa es amplia y muy confortable, y situada en una zona tranquila. Gracias por todo, Carney Family
 "
1544702,11956159,2014-04-20,12752673,Daniel,"Our experience at Marys Ocean view was excellent! Mary and Barney were always so helpful, open, and accomodating. We had trouble arriving on time due to public transportation repairs, but even then the Carneys left everything set for us. We felt we could really count on them for assistance or anything we could need while staying at their place. The place was great, very clean (all parts of the house, specially bathroom), the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The distance to the Red Line T station is easily walkable. We would definitely come back when staying in Boston, and we strongly recommend to anyone."
1544702,12191471,2014-04-25,5063159,Tomasz,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was excellent! Barney and Mary are wonderful welcoming hosts and the house is beautiful. There are ocean views throughout this elegant, perfectly located house in a calm neighbourhood that is just a short train to downtown Boston. The beds were super comfortable, the bathrooms were so clean and well designed.   I was here for one night with a friend, during a trip to the coast of Massachusetts.  Barney helped us make the most of our time in Boston by suggesting places to visit nearby and in Cambridge, as well as a restaurant nearby that turned out to be the best Indian food that I have ever had in my life.  The next time I come back to the Boston area, I would check for availability here first and book without a second thought.  "
1544702,12255382,2014-04-27,6031359,Tovah,"The Carney family have a lovely home in a really convenient part of town.  My stay was only very brief but the room and bathroom(s!) were clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated.  

Mary was away when we stayed but Barney was the absolute epitome of hospitality. 

If I am ever in the area again I would definitely look for a vacancy here."
1544702,12437964,2014-05-02,11559749,Ralitsa,My friend and I just had another great stay at the Carney's house! Great place to stay when you are visiting Boston!

Loved it. "
1544702,12619768,2014-05-06,13530189,Aaron,"Very hospitable hosts, comfortable and cozy room, excellent location. The list of pluses goes on and on...

Our stay in Mary's Ocean View was a key element to the wonderful experience we had during our trip to Boston. Great neighborhood to call ""home"" for a few days. Facilities (i.e. bathrooms and bedroom) were immaculate; and the fresh muffins, coffee and juice that were provided were the icing on the cake. We chose the king size bed set-up and were very pleased. Beautiful view from the room. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a refreshing stay. "
1544702,12747322,2014-05-10,2008011,Swati,"Our stay with Carney family was just wonderful. The room was well lit-up. The bed, the linen, sets of towels, the bathroom everything was just excellent. If we ever come to visit again Boston, this place will be our first preference."
1544702,12805791,2014-05-11,14941346,Michele,"I really enjoyed my stay. It was a beautiful house, I want one like it now. The neighborhood was unique. I told all my friends that I would love to go back and had a wonderful experience. My hosts were great, very warm and personable. Thank you so much for make my trip so nice.

"
1544702,12954507,2014-05-15,11969930,Sophie,"My parents and I had a great time staying at the Carney's. The Mary's room is very cute, and the house was very easy to find off the metro as well. Mary and Barney were extremely accommodating, and showed us where the market was so we could use the kitchen to cook a few meals. I would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Boston! "
1544702,12991683,2014-05-16,9294243,Carey,i really love this apt. everything is perfect. the room is nice and clean. host is a nice lady.i think this is the best room i have ordered in airbnb.
1544702,13176687,2014-05-21,12334472,Mardi,"My son and I spent 5 nights here.  The room was comfy and quiet . Nice hot coffee ready and waiting, fruits, yogurts and juice...muffins all there for enjoyment.  we were on the third floor, stairs are steep, but no trouble. Beautiful, clean bathrooms and plenty of hot water for showers were appreciated.  The hosts are very accommodating and great to chat with, and I felt free to come and go without being obligated to hang out.  The back porch provided a nice space where I sat and did some knitting  while I did a load of Laundry.  Wireless internet access cemented the experience, as I was able to connect up with my husband on the west coast....missing him, but able to see him on my device! Had I known how easy it was to get around town by transit I would NOT have rented a car.   Waste of money.  I will be happy to return.   Thank you Mary and all of the Carney family!"
1544702,13229633,2014-05-22,9416261,Andrew,"Barney and Mary Carney have a beautiful Victorian family home, on three floors,  overlooking the water.  My room was spacious and quiet, and the bed very comfortable.The shared bathrooms (I had a choice!) felt perfectly private. Fruit, muffins and cereal were available at all times, and coffee materialized by magic in the early moring on the landing outside the room. The welcome was warm and I would love to have stayed longer."
1544702,13342695,2014-05-26,12429893,Ewelina,"We spent 4 nights in this huge and beautiful house. Carney family is very friendly and answered all our questions about Boston. The location is great, the rooms/bathrooms are very spacious and clean and breakfast delicious. We have a  very pleasant stay. Thank you!"
1544702,13667394,2014-06-02,1714827,Kate,"My fiance and I had a wonderful stay in the Carney house!  Our room was large and private with a pretty view of the bay outside our window.  The house is in a lovely neighborhood.  The Carney's had fresh-brewed coffee, homemade muffins, individual orange juices and milks, yogurt and a wide variety of cereals at our disposal for breakfast every morning.  If we to ever come back to Boston we would definitely stay at the gorgeous Carney house again!"
1544702,13734366,2014-06-03,12429893,Ewelina,"Thank you Mary and Barney one more time, your b'n'b was a very comfortable place to stay. "
1544702,13834159,2014-06-05,5754308,Emilie,"The room was perfect, in a really nice house with a lot of charm. The neighborhood was calm. 10 minutes to T, and then 15 minutes to downtown. The hosts were really considerate, providing us with breakfast, bathrobes, bath products, etc. We loved our stay at Carney's family and we recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Boston!"
1544702,14112896,2014-06-12,12459132,Tiana,"My mom and I stayed with the Carney family for 7 days while looking for an apartment in Boston. Not only was the room immaculate, but we could not have asked for better hosts. Disregard anything you've heard about Dorchester if you are staying here. The area is beautiful and we felt completely safe throughout our stay commuting to the T. Both Mary and Barney are the sweetest people. Barney helped my mom map a running route in the mornings, made muffins, and shared stories with us about his beautiful, talented children. Mary was still awake when we returned late one night with baked goods from the North End and she gave us coffee to accompany our treats. I plan to try booking with them anytime my family visits me in Boston in the future. "
1544702,14189164,2014-06-14,6398051,Thomas,We had a wonderful stay at the Carney family's house. Mary and Barney are great hosts and they provided us with great information about the area and the possibilities of sightseeing. The communication before the stay was perfect. We received detailed information. Our room and the bathroom were very clean. The location of the house is perfect with the metro station near by. I definitely recommend the Carney familiy to other airbnb travelers!
1544702,14254191,2014-06-15,4941630,Gaetan,"The house is really nice and the hosts very welcoming! We had a really good time there, thank you!"
1544702,14556060,2014-06-22,14223578,Marco,"Carney home assolutamente consigliata. Se volete vivere l'esperienza di provare una vera casa Bostoniana questo  e' il posto giusto. La casa si trova vicino alla baia, in un tranquillo quartiere di Boston con la metropolitana a meno di dieci minuti a piedi. Barney e la sua famiglia sono stati ospitali e sempre pronti a dare suggerimenti e consigli sulle cose da vedere in Boston. La camera in cui siamo stati alloggiati era spaziosa e i bagni veramente in ottimo stato. A chi piace un ottimo caffè lungo e muffin fatti in casa."
1544702,14633949,2014-06-23,16112092,Kainan,"I'm so lucky, Barney and Mary accepted my application very soon even I'm a green hand in AirBnB without any reviews and even don't know need to do profile verify. Savin Hill is only 20mins away from Boston, green line can get to, it's peaceful area with very nice persons. Barney's home is cozy,clean,very comfortable bed, big bathrooms. Have a chance to meet Barney face to face, very kindly gentleman! Highly recommended to living here! "
1544702,14971573,2014-06-30,15694672,Allen,Living with the Carney Family was an absolute delight! They have a beautiful home and was very welcoming in every way possible. 
1544702,15091922,2014-07-02,5277678,Linda,"This is a delightful place for a visit to Boston.  The large house is within walking distance of the red line, a short walk to the water, and within walking distance of the JFK library.  Mary and Barry are warm and friendly and have a number of welcoming touches.  They've redone the third floor bedrooms and baths, and they are lovely.  Not that it is a long walk up to the 3rd floor, though.  They also have three rooms on the first floor.  "
1544702,15163305,2014-07-03,230261,Jaira,"It has been said that the details are everything and the Carney Family hits all the right notes! The lovely home is in a convenient location near a nice little beach area for walking and reflection. The place is just a short walk from the metro station. It feels like a home away from home. The only regrets I have about the Carney Family home are that 1) I didn't meet the lovely people who were so communicative, warm and inviting for my arrival and 2) I didn't stay longer. This place ranks among the top spots on my list for AirBnB experiences. I can't wait to book again!"
1544702,15236747,2014-07-05,16972416,Conely,"My best friend, Karen, and I had a lovely stay. Our room was clean, bright and comfortable. Mary was an excellent host and Barney's homemade muffins and freshly brewed coffee made for a wonderful start to our day. Thank you, Carney Family!"
1544702,15409532,2014-07-08,5883261,Sarah,"We only stayed with the Carney family for a short time, but the room was very nice. They set it up in the king bed for us. Barney was very helpful in directing us with the train, good places to eat, and fun things to do. Very accommodating! Thank you!"
1544702,15574668,2014-07-12,14906434,Anick,It was a nice experience for our first AIRNB
1544702,16883133,2014-08-04,6121867,Kate,"This was a really unique and amazing experience.  Mary and Barney always went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating, not only to me but to all their guests. I stayed with two other colleagues for three weeks in Mary's Ocean View, and during that time I was surprised that I didn't have to wait for a bathroom, the laundry room, or for the use of the stove in the common kitchen, and I was always able to find a place for a moment of quiet.  I met many different people from all over the world which made for some very interesting conversations.  The fresh muffins that are provided every morning along with all the other wonderful breakfast options are delicious, as well as filling and quiet the variety.  

The Kitchen:  enough space in the fridge for personal groceries, was provided labels to put on all food, was given a shelf in a cabinet for non-perishable items, use of all dish ware and cooking utensils, dirty dishes could be placed directly into the dish washer and were washed on the daily by the Carney family, there is also a second smaller fridge on the top floor which made it convenient to keep a few items in for easy and quick access. 

Laundry:  even though I brought my own laundry soap and fabric sheets it looked like the Carney family provided those supplies for their guests, never had to wait long.

Bathrooms:  there are two on the top floor both fully equipped, shampoo and soap were provided, beautiful views from both bathrooms, plenty of natural light filtering in, both very clean and everything was constantly replenished and available from TP to tissues, towels, and a hairdryer.

Bedrooms:  Our room was great, slept three very comfortably and still managed to give each of us our own space, there was a night stand for every bed, great natural lighting, very warm and inviting room, you can see the ocean from one of the windows, towels, robes, and slippers are all provided.

Neighborhood:  a quick 8-10 min walk to the T (train station), beautiful street with unique houses, felt very safe walking late at night, very friendly neighbors, cars tended to go a little fast for a residential neighborhood so walk with caution across the streets.  There is plenty of little stores and food options off of the T stop.  The beach is truly right down the hill of their backyard and it is a beautiful area to sit and relax, never found it crowded, great place for a run as well.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in a very clean, warm, and inviting bed and breakfast (that is truly what it feels like), where you are taken care of and yet given your space.  Mary and Barney are incredible people with a beautiful home.  This was nothing short of wonderful and I look forward to staying next summer. "
1544702,17040280,2014-08-06,14506025,Yunacon,Carney Family and their house was sooooo nice!!! It was really great to stay there. I really loved it. And their muffin was really great. I wish i can buy in store really!! And Carney family was so friendly and considerable. Also the room was so clean and perfect! I hope i could stay there again. Thank you so much.
1544702,17199195,2014-08-09,14042994,Simon,"Barney's muffins are his trademark for sure, they are delicious :) Very comfortable, great spacious room and great bathroom with a nice view. Barney help us to find our road back home. Really close to the train. He gave us good info where to go. Going back to Boston, I'll go back there."
1544702,17363745,2014-08-11,4014434,Todd,"The Carney Family has a beautiful home, offer fresh muffins and coffee in the morning and made us feel like family friends in for a visit. The room was large and bright and the bed was comfy. The house is a short walk to the red line T, which basically connects you to the major sights in Boston. We loved our stay! "
1544702,18099510,2014-08-21,9318628,Holly,"I loved this place so much! This was the most warm hearted and professional air bnb I have stayed. Barney and Andrea are very easy going and generous. The home is beautiful and close to the waterfront as well as the metro station. They provide delicious coffee, yogurt, fruit, cereals and muffins which were a nice treat. They have maids who clean regularly so everything is spotless. I only wish I could've stayed longer."
1544702,18525160,2014-08-28,13145701,Jessica,"The Carney family had a beautiful house, and we felt right at home as soon as we arrived. The neighbourhood is very safe and is ideally situated next to the beach but close to the t train. It was real bonus getting muffins and orange juice for breakfast and the carney family were always on hand to solve any problems or answer any questions. 

If we go back to Boston we would stay here again, thank you!"
1544702,18936232,2014-09-03,14029615,Caroline,"A big ""Thank you"" again to Mary and her family.
We feeled really welcome and the coffee with a fresh baked Muffin every morning was great!
The two-bed room was comfy, clean and really nice! The view out of the window with sunrise above the harbour was every day breathtaking!!
The beach and the subway are really good to reach. 
And we are sure we come there again!! :-)

1544702,19113977,2014-09-06,14296478,Elizabeth,"Our host did a great job, especially considering it was a last-minute reservation. The accommodations were great-very well-suited to having guests. It was a great neighborhood-lovely old houses and I felt safe leaving my car on the street. The closest T stop-Savin Hill-is a quick walk."
1544702,19190652,2014-09-08,16165203,Judith,"Het huis oogde nogal rommelig. Er was nauwelijks spaken van interactie met de eigenaren, wij vonden dat jammer. Ontbijten op een bankje in een halletje of op je bed, ronduit slecht! Heerlijke douches, goed sanitair. Dicht bij het centrum, wij zouden niet opnieuw voor dit adres opnieuw kiezen en of aanbevelen."
1544702,19293532,2014-09-09,16453323,Renata,"The room was very clean, the house  is very close to down town,bus station and airport. The host gave us very clear directions how to find their house so it was very easy. We really enjoyed our staying with Carney family."
1544702,19508864,2014-09-14,813140,Jürgen,We had a very good sleep at the CarneyFamily's house. The room and bathrooms were very clean and comfortable. A good pleace to stay if you want to explore Boston.

1544702,20275790,2014-09-27,15939624,Erin,"Our stay at the Carney's was awesome!!  My mom and I loved it.  As others have mentioned, Mary gave us very clear and helpful instructions of how to get to their place from the airport and then on how to access our room.  We had a very sweet room upstairs and enjoyed the other travelers staying up on the third floor as well.  Their place felt like home for the week we were there.  Everything, including the bathrooms, was clean and well kept.  As others have also mentioned the fresh, home baked muffins every morning were such a treat!  We even heard their son playing excellent music on their second floor piano one evening - which was also a treat!  I think the only little thing that might be challenging for some was staying in the room right next to the breakfast nook meant that sleeping in (past 7 am) was not really an option.  I'm not sure that would really matter to most travelers.  I would definitely stay there again!!"
1544702,20366417,2014-09-28,16961250,Christian,"My wife and I spent here just few hours, but we felt like home. Room was awesome, neighborhood was very quiet and nice. Also check in and check out was very easy. We got perfect directions for parking and a restaurant from Barney and of course, I had his awesome Muffins for breakfast."

1544702,21654458,2014-10-21,19328913,Lynn,"What a warm and welcoming home! Staying with the Carneys is like staying with dear friends. They have a beautiful home on the water in a very cute neighborhood. It's walking distance to the metro and the accommodations offer so many thoughtful touches--extra blankets and pillows, robes and slippers, and breakfast treats such as yogurt with Mary's homemade granola, Barneys muffins, fruit, juice, and coffee every morning. The other airbnb visitors to the house were terrific, too.  Its such a fun place to be! You'll love it!"
1544702,21820901,2014-10-25,12095527,May,"As this was our first time staying with an Airbnb host we didn't really know whatnot expect.  However, we knew as soon as we arrived that we would be very happy in Mary & Barney's home.  By chance they both greeted us at the door and we were shown to our lovely ""Mary's Ocean View"" room.  The breakfast table (just outside our bedroom) was well stocked each morning with fresh coffee and Barney's freshly made muffins, as well as a full fruit bowl and a fridge containing yogurts and preserves.  The area is lovely and we felt very safe on our 7 minute walks to and from the station where there are frequent trains in and out of Boston City centre and beyond.

In all, we couldn't redommend The Carney Family home enough as a great place to stay whilst visiting Boston.  Should we return to Boston we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else."

The Carneys were wonderful hosts. The house was beautiful  and clean. The neighborhood was safe and pleasant.  We hope to
stay there again for upcoming visits to the Boston area!"
1544702,22088978,2014-10-29,18361157,Sandeep,My first Airbnb experience. I was here for two nights. It was a good experience. Great hosts! They provided everything I needed. Walking distance to the subway. Adequate parking since I had a car with me. Thanks again.
1544702,22302530,2014-11-03,21468638,Dalton,Mary and Barney were absolutely amazing hosts. They made our stay in Boston much more enjoyable. Full recommendations.

1544702,22463688,2014-11-07,22535867,Yasuhiro,とてもいいところでした!部屋はおしゃれでシャワー室、トイレもきれいで非常に落ち着きました。部屋に入ると水がおいてあり、旅人への気遣いが感じられました。朝には出来立てのマフィンが部屋の前においてあり最高でした。ホストのBarneyはなんでも相談に乗ってくれる暖かい人でした。是非おすすめします。
1544702,22529668,2014-11-09,21537432,Asako,"Carney family was a great host! We just stayed only two night and we couldn't have few chances to talk to them. However, they made muffins for breakfast and provided coffee and tea. The room which we stayed was amazing. They set a variety of towels, water, and bathrobe. We definitely spent great nights in their house. We even wish we could stay longer."
1544702,22769046,2014-11-14,16885187,Rie,"I stayed this room for five days with my friends! Room was very clean,comfortable,nice......

I recommend to others to stay here. better than hotel in the central.

Thank you for everything!!!!"
1544702,22817993,2014-11-15,23589689,Judy,"Comfortable stay. They provided an extra bed because we had an extra person. Unfortunately I wasn't able to check out the nearby beach. They have wifi, slippers, robes, local guide and standard toiletries. Enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. I left my charger and they were kind enough to offer to send it.
Very satisfied !"
1544702,23234745,2014-11-25,19837124,Shuang,They are really nice and sweet. Their house is warm and good. The view is also impressed. We will come back to stay here next time. I strongly suggest you come to stay this house :) 
1544702,23670153,2014-12-07,24463349,Angelita,It's so great to live in here. I will come back again:)
1544702,23803602,2014-12-10,19482406,Matt,"We stayed five nights at the Carney house, and we couldn't have been happier.  The house is large and expansive, but not cold, even in the middle of December.  It was very easy access getting to and from our room, even though it was on the top floor of the house.  The views out the window were nice, and the beds were comfortable.  And Barney's muffins were tasty, as was Mary's granola, and there was some tasty homemade jam in the fridge, as well.

The best part about it for me was the dedicated guest-use kitchen on the first floor.  I wound up cooking three full meals.  My goal was to leave it cleaner than I found it because I appreciated the use of it so much.  My daughter and friend (and me as well) loved the bathroom set up.  There are very nice two full bathrooms situated right next to each other, with great hot water and gigantic tubs.

Another great part of our stay in the Carney house was the piano.  Mary's son would play in the evening, along with other guests playing from time to time.  Mary and Barney were both very helpful and accommodating, and never invasive to our personal space.  The house is 100% smoke free and smelled fresh and clean, and sometimes smelled of a tasty dinner Mary was cooking.  Plus the T and Dorchester business area is a quick walk away. 

It was a great stay and I highly recommend staying at the Carney Family house."
1544702,27638671,2015-03-09,23990085,Andrew,"This was our fist AirBnB experience and it was a great way to start! The house was beautifully maintained and had lots of charm.  Barney's morning muffins, coffee, and other breakfast items were a great way to start the day. Both Mary and Barney were pleasant to be around when we did see them, but for the most part let us have our own time. Pushing the beds together to make the king sized bed was a little awkward since the frames created a gap in the middle, but we made due shifting the mattresses around a bit. Overall the experience was fantastic and would definitely return for another stay!"
1544702,27851046,2015-03-13,25794934,Meredith,"The Carney's are amazing ! Second stay at their beautiful home. I will be returning for several weeks coming up, as well!"

1544702,28322697,2015-03-22,24018243,Lauren,The house is beautiful! We loved our room and the shared living spaces are also great. The family was very kind and friendly--Barney gave us several places to visit in city. The train station is an easy walk and the neighborhood is charming. I would definitely stay again!
1544702,28715299,2015-03-29,27807605,Jay,"Great place to stay and work while also easy to get around Boston. Excellent place for people needing to do work at U Mass Boston or JFK Library. Coffee and muffins start every morning, and the facilities were lovely. Highly recommended. "
1544702,28953345,2015-04-01,29101092,Laine,"This is such a wonderful and beautiful place to stay! The commute is not far from the subway or downtown, and the area feels really peaceful and safe. The company staying in other rooms at the time, was so nice. The accommodations are clean and comfy. There's even fresh coffee!"
1544702,29021978,2015-04-02,21453560,Richard,"We spent one night in this room before making an early departure to the airport, so we didn't get chance to meet the family. However, it felt like a really top class b&b, with fantastic rooms and beautiful spotless bathrooms. The kitchenette outside our room was very handy, with lots of essentials (and luxuries) provided - Mary's granola was amazing!"
1544702,29523115,2015-04-08,29664669,Juan,"I extremely recommend Carney's house,clean and cozy!Mr Carney is really a nice person who cooked muffins and answered every questions patiently,I must be stay in his house if I come back someday!"
1544702,29745020,2015-04-12,27489332,Péter,"Szép a kertvárosi környék, közel az óceánpart sétálni, futni. A metró sűrűn jár (átlag 5 percenként), a megálló (Red Line - Savin Hill) kb. 10 perc kényelmes séta. A belváros 10-15 perces út. A reptérről ingyenesen, Silver Line busz majd South Station-től Red Line-al lehet eljutni kb. fél óra alatt.
A ház otthonos. A szoba tiszta és kényelmes, az öbölre néz (mint ahogy a neve is mutatja), az ablakból gyönyörködhettünk a napfelkeltében. A fürdő tiszta, hotel színvonalú és jó felszereltségű. Minden rendelkezésre áll, törölközők, tusfürdő, hajszárító, reggelihez tej, gyümölcslé, kávé, tea, gyümölcs, Barney muffinja és Mary müzlije :) Barney és Mary kedvesek, segítőkészek. 
Mindennel nagyon, nagyon meg voltunk elégedve!!! Ha ismét Bostonban járunk biztosan ide jövünk!"
1544702,30009766,2015-04-15,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),"Great, as per usual.  I picked up a shirt I left here months ago.  See previous reviews for praise."
1544702,30693950,2015-04-26,7153444,Tobias,"Staying at Carney's house was a FIRST CLASS AirBnB experience. They had definitely taken being hosts to a new level.
From the very nicely decorated rooms, cozy beds to muffins and bagels in the morning.
Their house is in a beautiful spot and I can really recommend going for a run by the water. 
A couple of minutes away is a train station that takes you into the center Boston rather quickly. Boston being a very walkable city, you don't need a car."
1544702,30825189,2015-04-27,31279659,John,The Carney's and the house itself were both very warm and welcoming.
1544702,31188319,2015-05-03,17671203,Lily,"The Carney family was so incredibly friendly. They left really clear instructions for arrival and check out. They checked in for questions, provided great recommendations for restaurants and allowed us a lot of freedom in the house. The self serve breakfast worked perfectly for us given our early mornings. 

The room and bathroom were large, bright and clean (exactly as pictured). The rest of the house was beautiful. Conviently located on the redline of the T, easy communte downtown Boston or Cambridge. "
1544702,31369856,2015-05-04,31500892,Dagmar,"We were warmly welcomed by Barney and his wife. The room is very cosy and completely corresponded to my expectations. The location is perfect if you want to visit Boston (15 min. by the subway to Boston downtown). We could leave our car during on the private parking place in front of the house the day of our departure, which was very convenient.
"
1544702,31599360,2015-05-07,31542870,Florence,Many thanks to the Carney Family! A very friendly and nice place. Hope to go back sometimes.
1544702,31968309,2015-05-12,31481039,Sandro,"Mary and her family were very friendly. The house is very nice, the window of my room (Mary -ocean view) viewed to the Boston bay and ocean. The neighbourhood is realy fantastic and 10 minutes far to metro red line by walk. The room is exactly as described. In the 3rd floor there are 3 rooms with 2 shared bathroom: clean and cozy. I really enjoy the Grace song played with piano. Hope to come back again. Arrivederci"
1544702,32084559,2015-05-13,23696126,Sara,I had a great time staying at their place! Mary and Barney are two wonderful hosts who are dedicated to help you and make you have a great experience in Boston. The house and the location are beautiful and very close to the subway and the room is very cozy and inviting. I would definitely stay with them again!
1544702,32764583,2015-05-21,24014593,Emily,"This was a great place to stay for my mom and myself.  My mom had never stayed in an airbnb and she thought it was absolutely delightful (she keeps talking about it!).  The house is beautiful and comfortable with great views.  Loved the little nook just outside our room with the homemade muffins, yogurt and granola. Appreciated the willingness of family members to help us out when we had questions.  The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was lovely.  I'd like to stay again in the future if I'm in Boston. "
1544702,32836254,2015-05-22,31872469,Stefania,"My husband and I stayed with Carney family for one night during our first time visiting Boston and we loved it. The house is located in a very nice neighborhood and in walking distance from a metro station, which makes the transit to the downtown very easy. The room and the bathrooms were very clean and nice with views to the harbor (……including the bathroom). We had access to the kitchen and the porch but we had no time to use it. We enjoyed the fresh muffins and coffee that were available for us just near the bedroom. Mary got in touch with us in few hours from the time we made the booking and sent us lots of useful information. We loved the place and we will for sure return here. "
1544702,33498672,2015-05-29,4957782,Birgit,"We had a really great stay at Mary's and Barney's house in Boston! Everything was simply perfect: The exact route description before our arrival, the room (there were even bathrobes and slippers!!), Barney's muffins and Mary's granola....
The room and the (shared) bathroom were meticulously clean - in the bathroom there was showergel and body milk waiting for the guests - this house is definitely better than any hotel!! :)

We thouroughly enjoyed our time and strongly recommend a stay at Carney family to everybody planning a trip to Boston!

We definitely recommend this "
1544702,33820625,2015-06-01,8696040,Deborah,"Our hosts sent very detailed instructions on hoe to get to their home and how to find our room if no one was home. Their son was home and showed us to our room. The house is a large, older, three story home that had formerly been split into several units. The first floor and third floor are the guest area, while the second floor is where the family lives. They rent seven or eight rooms and we had the opportunity to meet people from four countries. 

Fresh muffins, homemade granola, yogurt and coffee/tea were provided, but unfortunately, neither of us could eat those foods. Fortunately, there were ample facilities to make our own food.

Our hosts were helpful, but unobtrusive.  For us, we would have liked a bit more interaction with our hosts, since that is one of reasons we choose BnBs over hotels. But if you want a nice place to stay at a reasonable rate, this is a good place to choose.

The location is great. There is ample parking if you drive and it is a reasonably short walk to the train which is only three or four stops from the city.

Good place to stay."
1544702,34013233,2015-06-03,32088341,Jill,"the house is very beautiful and clean,and prepared good breakfast too,
it gave us good rest in this trip."
1544702,34128859,2015-06-05,12907465,Yachao,"This room was booked for two of my family friends who travelled with us in Boston. They really enjoyed their stay both in the house and in this great city. The host, Mary and Barney,  made them fell very comfortable and relax. Thank Carney family very much again for their perfect hospitality."
1544702,34525543,2015-06-09,29293490,Martha,"The Carneys gave thorough directions and instructions prior to our arrival, and their home was easy to find, not far off the main route to downtown Boston.  We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood, birds singing in the trees. Our room very clean, with comfortable beds.  We enjoyed our stay!"
1544702,34949601,2015-06-14,30520131,如恩,"A great place to stay, I felt cozy and warm here. Highly recommended!"
1544702,35268413,2015-06-16,12096536,Marie,"As always, a welcoming place to stay. First time in this room. Great space. Comfortable and quiet.
Although there are two bathrooms that get shared, I have never had to wait or felt like it was a shared space.
My go to place in Boston."
1544702,35800028,2015-06-22,32366130,Alex,"Staying with the Carney family was great! The house and neighborhood were both very pleasant. I slept with the windows open, enjoying a cool summer breeze, and woke up to a beautiful view of the sun rising over the bay. Although it was a BnB, it felt as luxurious as a hotel. The room had a fresh carafe of water waiting for me which was a great welcome, the little things go a long way! In the morning I took advantage of the comfy bathrobe and slippers waiting for me in the wardrobe.

The hosts were also very accommodating when it turned out that I had to leave earlier than expected. Although I offered to pay for the missed days because of the short notice, Barney promised me that he would update the reservation so that I could get as much of a refund as Air BnB would allow.

Can't wait until the next time I'm in Boston so I can stay here again, my only regret is that I couldn't have stayed longer!"
1544702,36263080,2015-06-27,11197574,John,"My daughter and I enjoyed staying in the Carney Family home, the house is huge, the neighbourhood is quiet and the subway (the T) is a short walk away. The room was spacious and cosy with an ocean view, as described. The bathrooms were rather wonderful, having been recently refurbished. Breakfast was fine, with excellent breakfast tea (hooray!), though a wee bit more fruit would have been welcome. Overall, very good value and a great location for a visit to Boston."
1544702,36771446,2015-07-01,27104347,Shirley,"The Carneys sent directions for self-check-in which made it easy to find our room. Even though we didn't meet them first day, the next day when we talked I found Mary and Barney friendly and fascinating. They were great hosts, helping us when we needed help. Beyond helping us, they loaned us an Einstein book upon learning of my granddaughter's interest in math and physics. "
1544702,37543679,2015-07-08,21313116,Tatjana,"The room was nice and looked just like on the picture. We didn't met Mary often but when we met her she was always super nice to us. They served fresh muffins, milk and orange juice every morning. The bathroom was always clean. All in all we had a great time at Mary's and would definitely come back when we're in Boston again!"
1544702,37720376,2015-07-09,5595564,Amy,Wonderful stay! Barney was very helpful and we were very well catered for. Beautiful house and facilities and a handy location to the city. Highly recommend!
1544702,37773776,2015-07-10,9424228,Kristoffer,We had a quick night here with a late check-in and an early check-out. The place was in top condition and I would happily recommend anyone staying here.
1544702,37902864,2015-07-11,30741215,Samantha,"I had a short but lovely stay with Mary and Barney. The room was just what I needed, and the house was spotless, charming and had everything you'd need. Even though there were a few other guests staying in the house, you wouldn't know it - it was very quiet and peaceful. It's about a 10 minute walk to the T station which was very convenient, and I loved being able to run along the waterfront which was a short jump away. I didn't have much time to explore the neighbourhood but it felt very safe. Wish I'd been able to stay longer - and enjoy another muffin, delicious! Thanks for the great stay, I look forward to staying with you again the next time I come to Boston! "
1544702,39282720,2015-07-22,33863184,Keoni,"Coming from California, this was a great location, with great people, great accommodations, and great muffins! We hope to be back! "
1544702,39629053,2015-07-25,21495349,Bernadette,"It was a nice stay in Boston. At Carneys Family it was like living in a big family. Everbody had his/her room, bath all together. The little breakfast every morning was good."
1544702,40092690,2015-07-28,32018071,Masako,"Everything was parfect about their house. I felt as if we was staying in a traditional hotel with wanderful conveniences.
The family was very friendly and environment was so nice. 
We would not be more satisfied!
We'd love to stay with them again."
1544702,40574701,2015-08-01,26642704,Angelika,"Staying with Mary and Barney was very relaxing for us. The whole house is so comfortable and we felt at home there. The breakfast with Mary's granola startet our days deliciously and playing the piano was a treat.
The neighborhood is quiet and has beautiful old houses, around the train station are some nice places for dining.
When we needed something, Barney and Mary immediately helped us.
If we visit Boston again, we would definitely stay at their house again."
1544702,41189162,2015-08-05,26903127,Jim,"Fantastic room in a great location on the outskirts of Boston.  It is a $12 Uber ride to the centre of Boston and Barney and Mary were fantastic hosts, who had quite literary thought of everything"

Although we didn't interact with them much, it was clear they'd be available to help if we needed them. The room and facilities were as described and exceeded our expectations. Although there were several other guests in the house, it was a very quiet atmosphere which we were happy about. We were very pleased with the location of the house as well. It was a quick walk to the T station & with a 7 day pass costing only 19 dollars, you can't beat it! Perfect location if you want to be a in quiet area close enough to hop on the T and be in Boston within an hour. I would definitely consider staying with the Carney Family again! "

1544702,43985280,2015-08-23,16956674,Jessica,"Barney and the Carney Family were extremely helpful and excellent hosts. Before arriving in Boston Barney contacted us and made sure we knew where to park and gave us very detailed directions on how to get to the house. Once in Boston, Barney gave us a fabulous recommendation for a restaurant to get dinner at. The room was even better in person than in the pictures and the bathrooms are very spacious. My 6'5"" boyfriend said it was the first B and B shower he didn't have to stoop to wash his hair in haha! Overall, extremely pleasurable experience and will absolutely be visiting again :)"
1544702,44293360,2015-08-25,33365603,Fiona,"An absolutely fantastic place to stay! The house is beautiful , and the directions that Barney gave were brilliant. A very convenient place to stay  to get into the city and also very easy to get to the airport- so glad to have chosen to stay there!"

Rommet var rent og ryddig.Frokost muffisen var nydelige.  Nabolaget var rolig og koseligt .
1544702,45500971,2015-09-03,31367192,Claire,"We loved everything about the Carney Family and their B and B.  The room was great - they had set it up as a king bed with the two twins joined and it made the room open and spacious.  We met Barney on the day of arrival and Mary on the day of departure although Mary was available via phone right away when we had a question about the AC upon arrival.  We ordered take out from the Indian restaurant in the neighborhood because it was a broiling hot day and we just chilled at the B and B and relaxed after our long ride down from Vermont.  The rooms were spotless, the bathrooms beautiful!  Did not hear any noise from adjacent rooms and thankfully the AC kept us comfortable all night long.  We enjoyed a great walk through the neighborhood in the morning and loved the whole feel of the area.  Wonderful experience and we will definitely return again.  Thank you Barney and Mary!  "

We were warmly welcomed by the owner and given great advice on dinner places - just down the street - and then a nice tour of the house, our room, the TWO bathrooms, and the set-up for morning coffee,tea,danish, etc., which we weren't expecting.   So nice.   Then, had a nice visit with Mary, who gave us a tip for visiting the U of Mass campus, nearby and the Museum.   Room was very comfortable, nice decorating.   All was first rate, including the bathrooms, which were very up-to-date, clean and bright."

The hosts were helpful and welcoming and I really enjoyed my stay."
1544702,49931147,2015-10-07,41236639,Erin,"We stayed here on the last night of our trip. It was a great compromise between proximity to Boston and price. The room was large and the beds were comfortable though a little squeaky. There were two nicely updated bathrooms on our floor that were shared with other guests and a small sitting area with a mini fridge, microwave, teas, etc. Our host even had freshly baked muffins set out in the morning. The convenience of the sitting area was wonderful being on the third floor!"
1544702,50008453,2015-10-08,37385864,Birgit,"We only stayed one night and were perfectly satisfied. The room we stayed in was beautiful and spacious (as was the entire part of the house available to guests), and the breakfast was very good. The two single beds can be moved and put next to each other to form a double bed. Especially the bathroom was beautiful and included a very large shower. There is nothing at all that I could think of that can be improved, it seemed like the hosts thought of everything their guests could possibly need!"
1544702,50149032,2015-10-09,19334218,Christian,"La chambre est exactement telle que sur la photo. La maison est fantastique, la mer toute proche. Les muufins du matin succulents...
The room is exactly as shown on the picture. The house is awesome, very close to the see by a little path in the garden. Morning Muffins are more than fine.
Just to notice that if you haven't a car, there's nothing nearby for diner or lunch."
1544702,50424256,2015-10-12,1585449,Mandy,Would stay here again! What you see is what you get. Pics and description are accurate. Hosts respond within minutes to emails which is awesome. Hosts friendly and love Barneys home made freshly baked muffins! Its easy access from Downtown and the airport. It is beautifully clean and I especially liked the sensor lights to the bathrooms. Do yourself a favour....you wont be disappointed!
1544702,50830363,2015-10-15,33506826,Clément,"The apartment is really nice. I stayed there for a few nights with my parents. It is really clean and we had bathrobes given for the duration of our stay. It looks like you are in a hotel. Even breakfast is included. Even though you stay in one of their room you feel really at ease and cumfortable.

It is well located as it is 10 min walk away from subway station. Then taking the subway will take you to downtown in 15 min. 

Be aware that if you are three in the Mary's view on the ocean room, you will have three twin beds. When we looked at the pictures we fought there were two beds: a queen bed and a twin bed. 

Apart from that the only regret we can have is not having met Barney and Mary."
1544702,51113738,2015-10-18,6323565,Eszter,"Mary and Barney were very nice and helpful. Their house is so beautiful and very tastefully furnished, close to the center in an atmospheric and quiet neighborhood. Try Mary's granola, it is extremely delicious:)."
1544702,51307134,2015-10-19,43734179,Natalie,"Mary was a great host, letting me know where everything was. Everything  was provided and set, like the muffins and tea/coffee in the morning! The bathroom was roomy and the furnishings were nice in the room, location was in a quaint neighborhood. I'd stay longer if I could! "

1544702,51687289,2015-10-24,28063122,Silvia,"Das Zimmer war wirklich klasse und so wie auf dem Bild. Wunderbare Aussicht auf das Meer bzw. den kleinen Hafen dahinter. Auf dem gleichen Flur zwei Bäder, die einfach top waren - modern und vor allen Dingen picobello sauber. Ganz süß und praktisch die kleine Ecke auf dem Flur, wo man sich Kaffee, Tee, Toast bereiten konnte (was wir auch genutzt haben). Dazu standen immer Muffins bereit, Äpfel, Birnen, Joghurt und Cerialien sowie Orangensaft. Wir hätten auch die Gemeinschaftsküche im 1. Stock nutzen können, aber so war es besser und wir haben im Bett gefrühstückt. - Wunderbar. - Das Haus liegt in einer wunderbar ruhigen Gegend und durch den Garten runter ist man gleich an einer Promenade am Meer - auch absolut beschaulich dort. Nur 10 Minuten zur Metro, das schafft man auch gut mit 2 schweren Koffern. Im Zimmer gab es Pantoffeln, Bademäntel, Handtücher - da ist an jede Kleinigkeit gedacht worden. Die Matratzen super bequem. Wir haben uns von der ersten Minute an echt wohl gefühlt und bedanken uns ganz herzlich bei Carney Familiy."
1544702,52394811,2015-10-29,4776841,Angie,"Mary and Barney made us feel most welcome throughout our stay, and helped us with all of our queries with their excellent local knowledge. Ideal hosts, we would stay again.  
Both the room and the breakfasts were exactly as described on the listing - it was exciting to see which muffins Barney had made each day.....
Savin Hill was a very accessible neighbourhood, with a simple journey on the Red Line to anywhere in Boston.
"
1544702,52533349,2015-10-30,48177,Merisa,"I stayed at the Carney family residence for one night. Everything was great. I felt very welcome. The house is beautiful, and Mary and Barney really have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and easy from beginning to end, including a delicious breakfast muffin in the morning! The house is also a close walk to UMB which is great. I'd definitely stay again."
1544702,52834619,2015-11-02,39177793,Claudia,"Barney sent out very clear directions on how to get to their place, plus directions on how to get in the house and to the room my friend and I were staying in. The house is absolutely beautiful and the pictures do not do it justice. The room is very cozy and very, very clean. The bathrooms that are located on the same floor as the room are very modern and very clean. Barney and Mary have thought of everything prior to your arrival. The morning muffins, granola, yogurt, OJ, coffee, fruit, and tea are perfect and delicious. The walk to the metro is very pleasant and seems like a very safe neighborhood. The location of the house is great! If I ever visit Boston again, I will definitely try and stay here again! "
1544702,54299367,2015-11-17,11430046,Bob, Very nice place -- clean and well appointed and beautiful views. Off street parking and neighborhood were also great.

1544702,54893044,2015-11-25,47681981,Yui,The CarneyFamily was wonderful!!! The place was beautiful and in a quiet area with the ocean nearby. You can walk along the beach and enjoy the fresh air.

1544702,55334473,2015-11-29,49703509,Wen,The host helped us part around the house. Everything in the room look exactly as shown in the picture. This is a good experience overally.
1544702,55457443,2015-12-01,34071144,Gem (Zheng),We had a wonderful stay at the Carney's house. The whole house is so lovely and when we first got there we followed the instructions Mary gave us. And it was like an exploration to find our lovely room. The muffin Mary made was so delicious and we really enjoyed the talk with Barney and he showed us the songs his kids made. The whole house is decorated by the paintings the family made and all the furnitures are carefully placed. We will definitely choose Carney's the next time we visit Boston.
1544702,55644716,2015-12-03,12096536,Marie,Staying with the Carney's is like home.. Always welcoming. My go to place in Boston

1544702,56260060,2015-12-11,36827556,Di,It's been the best customer service I've experienced in my Airbnb listings. The house is well set up and the host is very friendly. Housekeeper cleans up frequently. The bedroom is full-sized. It does not has a desk though.
1544702,56720742,2015-12-17,46603080,Jennifer,"The Carneys were a great family to stay with. Though we didn't interact all that much, the space they provided for their guests was beyond expectations (i.e. breakfast items, bathroom amenities, first floor living room and kitchen, just to name a few). Mary's Ocean View was a great first Airbnb experience and I would love to come back in the future. "
1544702,57042878,2015-12-21,47278992,Damon,This house is amazing and a short walk to the red line. Our host were very accommodating and Barney made muffins from scratch every morning. Great place to stay when in the Boston area. 
1544702,57269836,2015-12-23,12096536,Marie,"As always, staying at the Carney's is the best. I am a regular there. Wouldn't stay anywhere else."

1544702,58957256,2016-01-05,46482986,Lance,"This was my second stay and I love this home.  Beautiful old victorian in nice neighborhood.  Convenient walk to the red line (unless you have a lot of luggage).  Room was in excellent condition, very clean, high-quality linens and bedding.  The room has no desk but I enjoyed working with my laptop on the couch in the common area (where I also had a nice chat with Mary Carney and I consumed the one remaining of Barney's muffins :-).  Very quiet house and neighborhood, with the exception that someone below had their TV on very loud around 1:30 am, but thankfully that only lasted a short while.  Restrooms are shared but clean and I've never had to wait.  The Carney's are pros, this home is an excellent value and well-worth the trip to Dorchester."
1544702,59659727,2016-01-13,52877844,Brian,I enjoyed my stay with the Carney Family very much!  It was very cozy and the muffins were delicious!  It had everything you need for a comfortable nights rest and I wish I could've stayed longer!

1544702,60973559,2016-01-30,14254203,Yun,"Mary and Barney's house were just simply gorgeous. It was situated in a really quiet neighborhood and close walk to the subway station (red line) and the ocean. We saw a gorgeous sunrise during our stays. 

The house itself is absolutely fantastic. The facilities were clean and well prepared for the guests. We loved the tea, yogurt, and muffins during our stay. 

A very good place to stay when visiting Boston. Will definitely stay with them again in our future visit to Boston"
1544702,61238872,2016-02-01,45197132,Nick,"What a great trip! -made even more fantastic thanks to the Carney family, and their wonderful accommodations. The listing description was spot-on. The Carney family are ranked as ""super-hosts"" for a reason!

The house, room, bathroom and amenities were all immaculately clean. This was a true bed&breakfast which made my friends and I feel like we were ""home"", but also pampered. 

Mary was incredibly communicative about the space, parking, check-in, etc. 
I honestly hope I'll be able to stay here again in the future.

Thank you so much, we had an amazing time!"
1544702,61591490,2016-02-06,32495070,Cristance,A very nice room with great view in a lovely area.  A very pleasant experience. Highly recommend.

Would always stay there again! "
1544702,62005132,2016-02-10,49585949,Eileen,"The trip to Boston is awesome! One of the important reasons is Mary's house. We lived in the third floor, Mary gave us detailed information in advance so we can park correctly and get into our room soon. The house is warm, clean and cozy. We love it."
1544702,62215518,2016-02-12,57810284,Emily,"it's really awesome to live here. The transportation is convenient to get to the center. The host is really kind.

We arrived at the house and found it so comfortable that we changed our plans for the day and just stayed in for the rest of the day. The house felt like a vacation resort. The family was very welcoming and hospitable. Thank you Mary & Barney, we hope to come back! Your house made our Boston trip!"
1544702,63939295,2016-02-28,23089003,David,Overall great place to stay if you're visiting Boston area. 
1544702,64885600,2016-03-08,56377665,Danilo,"Staying at Barney´s and Mary´s was very uncomplicated and convenient. They provide lots of small cute specials that are not expected, like all day fresh fruit as well as coffee and tea. Me and my daughter liked the bathrobes with slippers the most! Every morning there were also home made muffins. There is also a lot of parking space and the subway into the city is in walking distance, which makes it easy to explore Boston. The whole stay we felt like part of the CarneyFamily and would recommend this place a lot."
1544702,65029798,2016-03-10,56758885,Joel,"Very very wonderful, such a nice family, clean comfortable with lots of character."

1544702,65852770,2016-03-17,12096536,Marie,Mary & Barney always make me feel welcome. I can stop to have a conversation or spend a quiet evening in my room reading or catching up. I am a frequent guest and always feel welcome.
1544702,66461573,2016-03-22,57786171,Xue,"房子是一栋独立别墅,房源离地铁站较近,交通便利。房间私密性好,厨房和卫生间使用便利,环境整洁。房东很友善,提供了很详细的去各处的路线。"
1544702,66655288,2016-03-23,46482986,Lance,"My son and I stay at the Carneys occasionally when traveling to Boston on business so their place is starting to feel like home-away-from-home.  This time I took full advantage of their food supply, so I'll describe that - orange juice (not from concentrate), variety of teas and coffees, several different kinds of freshly made muffins and they were fantastic!  There is also homemade granola and organic yogurt.  Fresh apples (yes I ate all this stuff :-)  Sometimes they have a bowl of chocolates around.  Anyhow, you get the idea - you won't go hungry here :-)"
1544702,66798468,2016-03-24,62994708,Kaylah,I had a great experience staying with the Carney family.

Barney made us fresh muffins every morning we were there. He even let me borrow one of his belts when I realized I forgot to pack mine."
1544702,68401360,2016-04-04,25093432,Bronwyn,Lovely warm home with great morning muffins. :)

1544702,69770551,2016-04-13,8002318,Gregory,The accommodations were exactly what I was looking for. Convenience to the metro makes it very convenient. 
1544702,69970904,2016-04-15,1107225,Dawn,"We are so glad we chose Mary's Ocean View in Dorchester!  It was a great find! My daughter and I planned an unexpected trip to Boston on a fairly short notice.  We live in Alaska so planning a trip only a few weeks out usually makes if difficult to find accommodations.  We were so lucky to find this place. The accommodations were so comfortable, clean, and tasty too!  We stayed in Mary's Ocean View room and it was a special treat! The 2 shared bathrooms close to the room were large, fresh and clean and had a view too!  What a great surprise to find robes and slippers in our closet! The neighborhood was great! We passed a neighbor on the sidewalk on our first day as we were ""dragging our bags"" and they asked if we were looking for 231 and said we were almost there and pointed to the yellow house. Mary and Barney are great hosts and very helpful in not only making us feel comfortable and at home, but providing us with great information about local sights and highlights. We probably would've missed the JFK Library if it hadn't been for Barney pointing out its close proximity to their B&B, and it was a highlight of our trip!  Thank you Barney!  Mary and Barney were also flexible with our needs. The T was so convenient to use and only a short walk from the B&B.  I can't wait to visit Boston again and stay with Mary & Barney."
1544702,70869393,2016-04-21,9924951,Jenny,"Wonderfully clear directions for self check in to this awesome traditional Boston Victorian home. A very comfortable space- I felt very at home here - childhood memories of a similar large old home that I grew up in with its lovely tall ceilings, polished balustrades up to the top floor. And the self serve breakfasts were great. Fresh fruit, tea/coffee, homemade Granola and yoghurt and the homemade muffins of course! Great job Carneys! Very enjoyable stay!"
1544702,71382098,2016-04-25,66893897,Tiffany,"My husband stayed at this location. He said it was amazing, beautiful, and the hosts were very kind. Very clean and well kept."

1544702,73465395,2016-05-08,54679698,Yanli,"这是房东自己的房子,房东自己居住在二楼,而我们分别在一楼和三楼的房间里,Mary's room是两个窗户分别向东北的,向东那边是看到海,很美!值得推荐,早上还能看到日出!
环境优美,每天还有房东亲自为我们做的早餐,一楼有厨房,可供我们自由使用,总而言之,这里简直太舒适了,给了我一个很温馨的居住环境,可惜我们居住时间长,没有选到其他大床房,不然更舒适,对于两天一房来说,三楼两个房间都非常不错,但三楼另外一房是不向海边的!"
1544702,73839714,2016-05-10,65688186,建辉,"房东十分细心,在入住之前给我们很多有用的信息和描述,让我们轻松地找到一个陌生的地方。房子很漂亮,靠近海边,环境清净,离地铁站只要几分钟。房间整洁,卫生间设施齐全,在一楼的厨房也很方便,而且房东很热情,还贴心地为我们准备许多的生活用品和一些饮品点心等,让人感觉就你在家里一样。谢谢Carney Family!"
1544702,74221877,2016-05-14,56051675,Paul,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was an extremely positive one. The accommodations were exactly as described in the listing.

The host offers freshly baked muffin and cakes every morning. Just the bed is a little old and make some noise."
1544702,75929065,2016-05-23,35056663,Kelly,"excellent house!
we live in 3rd floor, quite hard for me and my girl-friend to take our baggage into room and leave.
we enjoy so much for the host self-make muffin and the coffee corner.
nice sea-view for our room. clean enough and comfortable. barney is a great host which i recommended."
1544702,76175785,2016-05-25,64677605,Jiayan,"房子离地铁站走路约10分钟路程,出地铁右转直走,非常好找,周围环境很好,海边别墅的感觉,非常不错!房东提供早餐,有麦片牛奶咖啡蛋糕水果等,非常好。"
1544702,76384960,2016-05-27,6181907,Peter,I had a wonderful stay over at Barney's beautiful home. Picturesque and easy to get into Boston (20 min by T). 
1544702,76865682,2016-05-29,6055934,Carolyn,Our stay at Barney's was amazing! Everything you could wish for and more!
1544702,77209031,2016-05-30,44422577,Nathalie,"I enjoyed a very nice room out of 3 in a beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood, close to the public transport (tram line). The house is located in a quiet street with views of the harbor and Boston University.
Both bathrooms are very new and very clean, which scored high with me!
The hosts have coffee & tea making upstairs, plus a small fridge with complimentary orange juice and yoghurt. Home made granola and muffins complete this very warm welcome.
It's period house, so you do hear the other residents on the landing (kettle, floor boards)."
1544702,77542848,2016-06-01,35854826,Liz,It was good. They provided breakfast. And everything was clean and cozy.
1544702,81994752,2016-06-26,67436277,Shantelle Leilani,"This was our first ever stay at an Airbnb rental. We really enjoyed it! Everything was exactly as advertised in their listing. We wish we could have spent more time there. 

We loved the neighborhood and architecture of the homes. Being from Hawaii we don't see homes like theirs often. Therefore, we took the opportunity to take pictures...of everything! 

Barney was very communicative. He responded to my emails promptly and was very detailed. We bumped into him when we returned from venturing around the Boston area, with our dinner and he showed us to the kitchen/dining area on the first floor. In that brief exchange, I could tell he was a very warm and welcoming person.

I have already recommended this listing to my friends on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). Thank you for allowing us to be guests in your home. Aloha!"
1544702,82398400,2016-06-27,77609260,Weiming,"The host wasn't there when we walked in, but he gave me clear instruction before hand, and he went up to the third floor to greet us once he came back. The room is wonderful and clean with a small ocean view. I was surprised that he even offered us muffins in the next morning, and we can have the yogurt, orange juice, etc. The bathrooms are outside the bedroom but they are perfectly maintained. I even got to play the piano a little bit. (I really love the fact he allowed the guests to play the piano.) In a word, the experience was amazing. I'll still book their room next time I visit Boston."
1544702,82670075,2016-06-28,71075100,Alma,"Barney was such a phenomenal host. Greeted us and showed us our room which I originally booked for 3 but ended up bringing another family and accommodated all 4 of us in the Mary's Ocean View room with such a short notice. Instructions were clear and concise. Residential location, quiet and walking distance to restaurants. The early morning freshly baked muffins were delicious and can smell it while it's being baked PLUS Mary's homemade granola along with yogurt was just the kind of breakfast we need prior to our planned activity. Will come back for sure. "
1544702,82875339,2016-06-30,56901304,Julianne,"My friend and I had a great time visiting Boston, and our stay at Mary's Ocean View made it even better. Though we didn't get to meet the hosts, everything in our room was perfect. They provided robes and slippers, plus the sitting area right outside of our room had fruits, muffins, and drinks. The house is beautiful and it's only about 15 minutes away from the places we went to, including Quincy Market and airport."
1544702,83671569,2016-07-03,40651868,Harry,"Wonderful stay in Boston.  I have stayed with the Carneys before, but it was my first time at Mary's room.  The room is spacious, and the house is only a short walk to the T.  Unfortunately I had to cut my trip short, but I am looking forward to being back at Mary and Barney's."
1544702,84170026,2016-07-05,69461107,희애,"It was an awesome place to stay. Foods, friendly hosts, classy facility and peaceful ambiance were perfect and amazing. Among my entire experiences, this one was the best! i definitely recommend this family's house."
1544702,84536757,2016-07-07,18584412,Bob,Everything was great - thanks
1544702,85372874,2016-07-11,77516893,Lingyan,"房东人真的非常好,在去之前发了几封邮件,介绍导航地点、网络及其它相关事宜,入住非常顺利。已经向朋友强力推荐了。"
1544702,87147370,2016-07-18,57367391,Edward,"This was an amazing place to stay. So friendly and helpful, great facilities, easy to get on the subway to the centre.
I would recommend to everyone who can walk 7 minutes to the subway to stay here."
1544702,87446002,2016-07-20,81743248,Chloé,Everything was just perfect!  I wish I would have had a little more time to explore the beautiful house and the rest of the property.  Having a little bit of food available all the time was just wonderful - the big bowl of bing cherries was heaven!  Communication was excellent and prompt!
1544702,88604096,2016-07-25,56664758,Meaghan,"Our stay here was great! We enjoyed the hospitality of the Carney family (great muffins!!), their beautiful home, and the awesome location. Thanks for a great stay!"
1544702,89227692,2016-07-27,80770981,Jacquelyn,Great place to stay. Had a good time visiting on the back porch with other families staying at the house. The Carney's were very friendly and available to answer any questions. 
1544702,89725217,2016-07-29,67375675,Daren,Host is great and the room is exactly as it shown. Highly recommended. 
1544702,93755291,2016-08-13,62371487,Karin,"I had two amazing weeks in Boston, and staying at Mary's Ocean View contributed to it. After spending the days in the buzzing city it was a real retreat to get home to the cosy, relaxed and beautiful home of the Carney Family. Barney and Mary had good recommendations on what to do in and around Boston and the smell of freshly baked muffins made getting up in the morning very easy. Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home. I can highly recommend it."
1544702,94650484,2016-08-16,19018611,Patricia,Très bon accueil mais nous avons été surpris du nombre de chambres louées et donc du nombre de personnes présentez même si la maison est grande. Les muffins du petit déjeuner étaient délicieux. Il était très appréciable d'avoir la climatisation vu les très fortes chaleurs!
1544702,94776976,2016-08-17,76012711,Sarah,"Clean bedroom and bathroom. Fresh juice, coffee, and fruit always available. "
1544702,96423512,2016-08-22,6390993,Markus,"We enjoyed very much staying two nights at the Carney family's well located and nicely decorated home. Our room was as described, all bathrooms very clean, and tea and muffins in the morning provided a good start for our Boston sightseeing. Getting to the city center is very convenient from the subway station nearby. In summer, don't miss lounging for a while on the wonderful front porch. Only small downside: our room's aircondition was quite noisy at night - and it couldn't be turned off, because it's a central system for all rooms."
1544702,97131291,2016-08-26,64791038,John,"We cannot fault anything - it really was a great stay here. The photos do not do this apartment justice either, they were lovely and the simple but tasty breakfast was also a welcome surprise. The location is ideal; 5 minute walk to the subway with a 10 minute train ride into the centre of Boston. There is also free parking on a private drive. "
1544702,98113292,2016-08-29,17180151,Isabella,"Very good experience. Everything as described. It's about a 10 min walk from Savin Hill station on the metro red line, in a quiet neighborhood. It's on the 3rd floor sharing 2 bathrooms between three rooms. I didn't have to wait for a bathroom ever. The twin separate beds in the room are comfortable. Like others have said, I really enjoyed the complimentary yogurt, granola, orange juice, as well as homemade muffins every morning. The common areas of the kitchen and living room are open to everyone. Barney's responsive by text and flexible about letting us leave our luggage before our flight. Definitely would recommend to everyone."
1544702,98909823,2016-09-02,30059403,Peter,"The Carney family have a lovely house in a quiet residential area a short walk from the station where it was easy to get in and out of the centre of Boston.  We hardly saw the Carney's but there were a number of other visitors staying who were interesting to talk to. Breakfast was good, with orange juice, fruit, English muffins, muesli and cakes and an area outside the bedroom to sit, eat and make drinks.
A small safe is provided in the bedroom for valuables but otherwise nothing is locked (including it seemed the front door) we happily left our old laptop in the room but it may not be ideal if you have an expensive laptop or camera you don't want to carry around with you."
1544702,99241699,2016-09-04,66763180,Mika,Great neighborhood and close proximity to the T. Will be returning!
1544702,100123775,2016-09-07,76045034,Becky,We felt very welcomed. The space was very inviting and included a great breakfast and wonderful amenities. 
1544702,100305855,2016-09-08,5199689,Leanne,"This place has the charm of an old world comfortable roadside Inn,  but with the modern amenities of internet, a safety deposit box, and warm muffins in the morning.  I had a third floor room.  The room was clean, the bathrooms were newly renovated and sparkling (I had access to two shared bathrooms), and the view was expansive. The three story house is located in a small area of historical homes, with very picturesque water views. It is too bad that the area is surrounded by highways, but this also provides easy access to anywhere you wish to travel to. The Carney's, Mary and Barney are lovely and professional.  Communication was very good on the lead up to my stay. I will definitely make this place my top spot to stay in Boston. "
1544702,101072907,2016-09-11,20328895,Ben,"This is one of the best Airbnbs we have stayed at. Incredibly chilled, clean and spacious. Delicious free breakfast too. Beatiful views of the ocean too. Amazing house and great family! You guys have nailed it. "
1544702,101498780,2016-09-13,80777388,Kantheera,The house was really nice. Everything is same as pictures. I like the ocean view. It was awesome. 
1544702,101900776,2016-09-15,4997576,Laura,"We loved staying at the Carney home.  We
were very thankful for the housekeepers, they were the one's who showed us in when we arrived and explained things to us.  The home is very clean and comfortable, they have tried to provide completely for the comfort of their guest. The home is run in a very low key way and we very much admired and appreciated the room, location and self-serve breakfast.  Would highly recommend The Carney Home to those visiting the Boston area.  "
1544702,102060112,2016-09-16,87095873,Thomas M,"This place was exceptional. From the walk down the street, to my meeting with Mary, to the view out the window, to the breakfast and my walk away from the house, and walk on the beach.
The home was very clean and friendly. I will definitely try to stay here again and enjoy the hospitality."
1544702,103093114,2016-09-20,75809019,Yunqiang,"房东非常的热心友好,房子交通便利,海景房窗外就是大海和游艇,室内清洁卫生,富有艺术气息。房主做的蛋糕非常美味,厨房里边常备水果。非常棒的入住体验,给满分。
The host is nice and kind. The traffic is convenient and the house is clear and full of art works. From the window you can see the beautiful sea and boats. The cakes made by hosts are very delicious and there are always fruits in each kitchen of every level. This is my best experience in Airbnb. Wonderful."
1544702,103702611,2016-09-23,68362456,Andrea,"Wir haben uns im Haus sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Lage war perfekt für unsere Boston-Tage, es ging schnell zum Nahverkehr, war aber auch ruhig genug um mit dem Auto entspannt bis vor die Tür zu kommen und abends gut schlafen zu können. Das Zimmer war perfekt für uns drei und es war schön, dass es immer Tee gab und sogar Frühstück. Wir waren sehr gerne bei der Carney Family."
1544702,104449146,2016-09-26,70711650,Marco,Terrific venue! Information of arrival details from NYC on Amtrak and subsequent T line subway system was extremely helpful and precise. The people sharing the house with us were delightful and enjoyed the beautiful home.
1544702,104700328,2016-09-28,74947854,Liping,We watch the Clinton and Trump debate together at night. It's wonderful! 
1544702,104964367,2016-09-29,92115537,安玥,"首先需要说明的是房间真的感觉很好,和图片看见的一模一样,从窗口可以看见海和帆船,如果不是天气太冷,真想去海边走走。
其次要说明的是房东,非常周到得提前发消息给我们,告诉我们如何乘坐地铁,从哪一站下车,下车之后如何行走,根据房东的指示,我们很容易就找到了目的地。然后非常惊喜得品尝了房东烘焙的小蛋糕,加入了不知道是不是打碎的芝麻,口感新奇但更加美味了,是外面面包店里面买不到的味道。另外有茶水果一直在那里,随时可以取用,真的非常周到,感觉像在家里一样。房东还非常安静,你基本上感觉不到他们,所以我们一点没有拘束感。去的时候遇见了他们的水电工,非常友好热心的一位先生,帮我们搬了行李,还为我们对周边环境做了详细的介绍,走的时候遇见了男主人,非常绅士得帮我搬了箱子,所以再次表达对他们的感谢。
这次波士顿的行程太短暂了,所以只能在这里住一个晚上,下次如果有机会再去的话,我觉得我一定还会选择住在这里的,推荐大家不用犹豫,选择这里作为波士顿旅游的居住地不会错的。"
1544702,105146580,2016-09-30,16688977,Christine,Instructions on how to self check-in was easy to follow. Everything was very clean. We loved that there were 2 full baths accessible to us on the top floor. The breakfast muffins with tea and coffee was great to have in the morning.
1544702,105642137,2016-10-02,95597310,Marc,"Nous avons bien apprécié notre week-end!  À 5 minutes de marche de la station Savin, situé à vue de la mer, propre et chaleureux, nous ne pouvions espérer mieux!"
1544702,106682202,2016-10-07,83844038,준석,"Clean, clean, clean !!

1544702,108112354,2016-10-14,40651868,Harry,"The room was very clean and comfortable.  Mary and Barney are great hosts, and their house is located in a quiet neighborhood, only a short walk to the T-station.  This is one of the best ways to get to explore Boston."
1544702,108897743,2016-10-17,34342905,Molly Elizabeth,"Our stay at Mary's Ocean View was lovely. The house is in close proximity to the subway station (just a 5-7 minute walk) and is easy to find. The room was clean and tidy and the bathrooms have been finished to a high standard. The house overall was cosy and quiet. Our hosts provided breakfast items including delicious fresh made muffins, alternatively there is a diner just by the subway station. A wonderful stay all in all! "
1544702,109164485,2016-10-19,8010594,Kirsten Lena,"Das Haus von Barney und Mary ist großartig und in einer guten ( und sicheren) Nachbarschaft gelegen! Leider haben wir nur Mary kennengelernt, sie war super nett und herzlich! Das Zimmer und die Badezimmer sind sehr groß und sehr sauber, und das Frühstück mit den leckeren Muffins sollte man auf jeden Fall nicht missen! Mit der Bahn ist man innerhalb von 10 Minuten in Boston, und in der Nähe sind sehr gute Cafés/Restaurants!! Wir kommen gerne wieder!!! "
1544702,109265441,2016-10-20,92560709,Quynh,"We loved our stay at the Carney Family's home. Our room was more spacious than the picture shows, very clean, and the beds were comfortable. Barney gave very thorough instructions on how to get from the airport to the house. The house is located near the T and it was free public transportation from the airport to the T. We self checked in and found clean towels, a pitcher of water, and Barney's delicious muffins waiting for us when we arrived. Barney responded quickly to our inquiries. We can't wait to come back again one day! "
1544702,110489051,2016-10-26,5422765,Mike,"Barney gave us excellent directions to his house and good advice to help us navigate Boston.  Really nice neighborhood and just a ten minute walk to the subway.  The third floor room is  large and spotless, just like the pictures. It even has a view of the bay.  The shared bathrooms are large, clean and well equipped.  We really appreciated the coffee, juice, muffins and granola to get us going in the morning.  We would definitely stay here again!
"
1544702,110796989,2016-10-28,37987771,Nora,Loved our short stay. It was close to the downtown Boston area without all the traffic. Fresh baked muffins in the morning were a plus! Very nice and organized set up. I would definitely stay again 
1544702,111780353,2016-11-01,95609104,Alexis,We had a wonderful stay here. The room was very spacious and the two shared bathrooms were clean and updated. The location was great being it is right outside of Boston. Self check in was simple and easy. The house was beautiful and exactly as pictured. Would definitely recommend! 
1544702,112371302,2016-11-05,37543245,Vikas,"Mary's Ocean View room was exactly as described in the listing. The hosts were very welcoming and had made all arrangements for our arrival.

There were muffins, granola, bread, a good coffee maker with sufficient pods and a fridge stacked with milk, juice, butter and jam giving us ample options for breakfast.

All the shared bathrooms were in excellent condition and the accommodation in general was extremely clean. For me this is very important as I am allergic to house dust and I didn't have any problems!

The Savin Hill Avenue neighbourhood was lovely! Would highly recommend this place for value for money and easy access to Downtown Boston as well as Boston airport as the train station is 8-10 minutes away by walk."
1544702,112839771,2016-11-08,70439032,Kelly,"The Carney Family property was my first Airbnb experience and  I hope my future ones will be the same because they have raised the bar very high! Mary's  Ocean View  Room is great for two travelers. It is spacious, there is a closet, two chairs and a dresser and a beautiful view. We loved the landing that had a Kuerig coffee maker, a refridge with snacks, and of course the wonderful muffins in the morning.  The bathrooms upstairs were spacious and modern and there was never a wait to use them. I loved  all the little touches, bathrobes and slippers, a bottle of water, the reading lamps, it was all very thought out.

Barney welcomed us  and made us feel  like we were family. He loaned me an adapter for my phone which we all know it is a lifeline. I love the location, it was a 6 minute walk to the Metro and it was easy to navigate. It is close to the Kennedy Library and there is a nice walkway to enjoy. We loved walking the neighborhood, it adds to the New England experience.

Hints: We were originally going to take the Metro to the house and walk, use Uber or a taxi. Keep in mind there are two flights of stairs to climb, so travel light or unpack part of your bag if it is heavy. I was transporting wine so I used a backpack to lighten the load of the suitcase.

Thank you Carney Family for sharing your home with us,
and to the people of the world you have welcomed as they
arrived in Boston to settle in the the United States. You are an
inspiration to me.

PS, I was an inn sitter for B&B's and you do a phenomenal job as hosts,
people have no idea what it takes to be gracious 24/7. You have put together a great team.


"
1544702,113953359,2016-11-14,91500281,Connie,"Lovely neighborhood & views. Short walk to red T line.
Morning muffins, granola & coffee super way to start the day.  The porch swings were lovely to sit on while waiting for Uber. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for an Uber ride.
If you have large heavy suitcases, keep in mind you will have 2 steep narrow flights of stairs to tackle. I didn't always welcome the exercise after returning very late every night.
There are no tv's in the bedrooms. Not a problem for me, but something to consider for some. 
I would definitely stay here again if I ever return to Boston."
1544702,114209138,2016-11-16,6359098,Matt,Barney and Mary were incredible hosts.  Everything that was advertised was spot on.  I enjoyed my stay there and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Boston.  Thanks Barney and Mary!

I LOVED my room--I stayed in Mary's Oceanview room and it was airy and bright. Barney and Mary have thought of every detail to make sure their guests are comfortable and happy, including towels and shampoo, blow drier, info about local restaurants, laundry facilities, and kitchen access. Also, they provide excellent communication and directions to the house. They provide everything you  need for an excellent stay, and are lovely to talk to. I will be staying here when I visit Boston again."
1544702,121241569,2016-12-15,12096536,Marie,I spend an average of two days a week here. It has made my job easier. I have chosen not to look anywhere else on Airbnb when it comes to spending time in Boston. absolutely no complaints.

There is a fully-equipped kitchen and living room available. This is my second stay, and just as lovely as the first stay. As for every place I've stayed in the Boston area, the ability to use stairs is a must!"

My stay was better than I expected. The locatiom was conveniently located 3 miles from Downtown Boston, the house and room were clean, spacious and organized. The Carney Family went above and beyond to make sure my mother and I were comfortable and I thought it was really sweet to have fresh baked muffins, coffee, tea and yogurt ready for us early in the morning. Thank you Mr. And Mrs. Carney for being great hosts! I will definitely be staying there again next time Im in Boston."

1544702,128920524,2017-01-28,87513906,Sebastian,Everything was outstanding in this accommodation. The place itself is well connected and the neighborhood is very safe. I recommend it 101%.
1544702,133950997,2017-02-25,110287909,Andy,"I thank Barney, Mary and the Carney family for a fantastic time in Boston. I had the pleasure to stay at their picturesque house for four weeks and enjoyed the room, the shared spaces, Barney's famous morning muffins and the exceptional hospitality every single day. The proximity to the Red Line T Stop meant a very easy commute to downtown Boston. I very much hope to be back soon!"

The house is beautiful and the set up for guests is nothing short of what you would find at 5 star hotel.  Plus, there is a lovely breakfast nook and fresh baked muffins every morning! The family is very nice and Barney is very knowledgeable of the Boston area.  I would stay at the Carney family place again in a heartbeat, and so should you!"
1544702,135330491,2017-03-04,27228773,Ricardo,"Carney family is welcoming and helpful. Everything was perfect during our stay. Breakfast was awesome and the house is very charming. They deserv every 5 star review they have. The only concern is the parking spots, at night sometimes there was no available parking in their yard, but the neighborhood was quiet so it was easy to find a spot in the street. The neighborhood is great but the house was a little bit far from downtown than I expected, but since it was my first time in Boston, that was my falt for not looking better at maps before."

1544702,139094612,2017-03-23,10070672,Cheyenne,"We stayed in Mary's Ocean View and it was fantastic! We loved the room and the view. The beds were super cozy. Everything including the bathrooms was tidy and clean. The two shared bathrooms actually felt like two own bathrooms! 
Also, a lot of AirBnBs skip on the second B, but not this one. Coffee, Tea, English muffins, jam, joghurt, milk, granola, apples, muffins! 
For anyone thinking that it's too far from the city center, it's not. It's a 10 minute walk to the station from where you can go downtown within 15 minutes and to Cambridge within 25. No changing trains. 
We loved it so much!"
1544702,140041975,2017-03-27,102910514,Jenny,"The Carney Family are phenomenal hosts. Their place is located conveniently close to the public transit and isn't far from the city at all. The neighborhood is safe and close to the bay. Cleanliness is a big thing for me, and I felt completely comfortable staying with them. They kindly provide breakfast accommodations too, who doesn't love free food?! I highly recommend staying here on your trip to Boston! That is, if they're not already booked! I can understand why they're so popular amongst the airbnb community. Thank you for a great experience! "

We loved having the coffee machine and refrigerator on the same floor. It was very helpful to be able to put our food there. My sister absolutely LOVED the muffins every morning! The house was clean and cozy, and it was very convenient to have two usable bathrooms. Getting to the T was easy as well. They were very hospitable and the home is lovely!"
1544702,142848880,2017-04-09,60594685,Arabella,The house is beautiful and room very comfortable. We loved the freshly backed muffins every morning. 
1544702,143823307,2017-04-13,34905908,Katie,"Good location, right by the water, convenient to the city. The house is very nice and the hosts were very accommodating. The beds could use some updating as my roommate and I both had trouble sleeping on the mattresses. The bathrooms were very clean. This house is an old family home so we really enjoyed the historical aspect of it. I don't think we quite realized that there would be 8-10 other people in the other rooms sharing the common space, giving it more of a hostel feel. We enjoyed meeting new people and they didn't disturb our stay. Would recommend! "
1544702,145769930,2017-04-20,72172500,Alexandre,"If I would write this review with just a few words, I'd say: Yes! Book this room!
But I'll explain: It's a very nice house, with very nice people and located in a beautiful neighborhood. 7 minutes walking to the T station that could bring you everywhere, we barely used our car.
You probably have read about how nice the Carney family is, the delicious muffins and granola, and the great spirit of people from everywhere staying in the other rooms that they rent.
What you also need to know is that the bedroom has plenty space for 2 or 3 people, the beds were super comfortable, the 3rd floor has 2 huge bathrooms and its own mini-fridge and coffee maker.
I went for the marathon week and I'm sure all this good energy was part of the great race experience that I had.
Thank you Barney, Mary and sons! Hope to be back next years!"
1544702,148350564,2017-04-30,5470449,Tim,"Our stay at the Carney family was wonderful! We had a great time and felt very welcome. The house was big, clean and in a great location. Barney's muffins in the morning were perfect and delicious every time. Hearing Barney deliver the muffins was like hearing Santa fill our stockings! We would definitely stay here again!"
1544702,148852678,2017-05-01,62325754,峻,"The host is really nice and beds are comfortable, the best point for me I Think it is the bathroom. It is really clean and nice. If I travel Boston again, I absolutely will come back!"

You'll have all the privacy you'll want, but the Carney family is more than happy to help the moment you have a,question. "
1544702,151403832,2017-05-12,28539803,Yingxuan,"CarneyFamily is a place with long history and full of artworks. Barney is so kind and very very generous. We like her muffin very much. The bay is just nearby. We met people from different countries, all of them are friendly. If you visit Boston, CarneyFamily is the warmest place to stay."

1544702,157346739,2017-06-03,132880592,Ting,"地理位置就在肯尼迪图书馆附近,波士顿城南,上下班高峰时期进城和出城的话93号公路会比较拥堵。房子的地理位置非常好,屋子看出去就是港湾,社区也非常安静,在波士顿算是比较有钱的社区了。房子装修的很新,屋子就和住在朋友家一样温馨。房东在你去之前会给你发巨长无比的消息,告诉你怎么找到他们家,怎么停车,怎么找到自己的屋子,怎么连接wifi...总之是远远超乎预期的民宿,绝对五星~"
1544702,157814015,2017-06-04,84509026,Laura,Bathrooms are Super clean! And beautiful. Great communication. Location close enough for a $19 Uber to everything downtown or you can walk to the T.

We caught a little league game, had a burger at Savin, walked along the harbor and just thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! The muffins and coffee were perfect while we woke up slowly, sat in the window and enjoyed the view! The robes and fresh towels were a great touch and the furnishings were resplendent! Our son asked if we could live here...we felt the same way! :)"

1544702,164443758,2017-06-27,122253390,Taylor,"The Carneys are great people who live in a gorgeous neighborhood.  They respond quickly to your questions and concerns, and provide all the amenities needed for an exciting vacation.  You will not regret your stay here.  The view of the bay combined with the picturesque neighborhood makes for a comfortable stay.  Even better, while the house is just outside of Boston, it is close enough to make travel a breeze.  The neighborhood is a short 10-minute walk from a Red Line transit station.  From here, you can go anywhere you want: Fenway, the Freedom Trail, Harvard, you name it.  The house is also a short walk away from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.  Whenever I take my next trip to Boston, I will definitely stay at the Carney resident again.     "

1544702,167390061,2017-07-06,108785308,Xiaoli,"房间完全与照片相同。从南站坐地铁很方便可以到达,车站步行约10分钟。社区静谧美好,依着海湾,应该是一个高尚社区。夏天,在湾岸边散步,非常的惬意。
房间和卫生间都非常干净整洁,坐在这幢古老房屋的茶几椅上,捧着一杯茶,听着鸟叫,时间仿佛静止了一样。
房间在三楼,拎大行李箱上楼有些累。会同时有其他租客入住,共享洗浴卫生设备,所以洗漱完要把所有东西再整理拿回自己房间。购买食物略有不便,据介绍说要步行20多分钟,所以没能去,本来想体验美式厨房也就不能了。
房东太太矜持有礼,乐意提供在波斯顿游玩的信息。"

Das Zimmer und Bad (sowie der Rest des Hauses) waren sehr sauber. Das Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Wohngegend und ist innerhalb von 10 Minuten von der Bahnstation aus erreichbar. Länger als 30 Minuten braucht man also nicht nach Boston!

Thank you Barney and Mary for hosting us!

P.S. The blueberry muffins were delicious!

The location is easy to find, parking is plentiful onsite (and on-street parking is easy), and the amenities are great (laundry, several bathrooms with towels and hair dryers, laundry room with iron, and a full kitchen). This airbnb is five-minute walk from the train station and you’re just ten minutes away from Downtown Boston. Just a general reminder to all guests, please be mindful of the quiet hours (9pm – 8am) since there may be other airbnb guests on your floor. 

Barney is a great host and we did not run into any noise issues/complaints with our group. If you’re looking for a party house or want to have loud conversations after 9pm, please find a different Airbnb. 

Barney: Thank you so much for hosting my group and with your flexibility of the late check-in. You have a beautiful home and I appreciate the tips of how to navigate through Boston during our morning chats. Thanks for the homemade muffins, too!"

It was close enough to the T, was in a nice nieghborhood and had pretty ocean and harbor views. It was very clean and they supplied nice towels and some needed toiletries.  I lived in a large house in MA when I was young. As I took a nap in the afternoon, I felt I was in my childhood home. The price was reasonable and the snacks and breakfast items were perfect! Thanks, I'm hard to please and I will comeback again."

The Red Line, which brings you to Boston downtown and Harvard directly, is only a ten minute walk away - a highly recommended spot for any Boston visit!"

The red line is very accessible from the house, so easy to get downtown as needed. There are enough things to do and see around the Savin Hill area, too, including really good places to get breakfast. The Carneys seem very accommodating and helpful. They provide a lot of information upfront about practically any question you might've had, but also feel really open to talk to if you have any other questions.

Our room and the private bathroom were perfect for us, very clean and the shower was very spacious too. The house is good situated 5 -10 minutes walking distance to the subway JFK/UMass Station (RedLine). The communication was perfect, Spencer & Elma were lovely hosts. We loved our stay at their home, they welcomed us friendly and during our stay we could ask everything. Special thanks for the movie evening /night, the great conversations and that you spent time with us and for your assistance while Tina was sick. Unfortunately, one of us got cold, but Elma & Spencer were very helpful with their advice. Our flight has been rescheduled so that we needed a late Check-In and Check-Out. This was also possible, after asking them. 
Everyone who comes to Boston should definitely check out this awesome city and their lovely home.
We already miss Bahston :-))) and as soon as we come back, we will try to visit you. Greetings from Switzerland and if you have the possibility to come to Zurich, let us know. 
Cheers Tina & Fabio

PS: We miss the beautiful tank with our favorite fish “Grandpa”."

2526773,18781978,2014-09-01,12172962,Amanda,"I stayed in this apartment for 5 months over the summer while working in Boston. The apartment is situated in a really lovely residential area of Brighton with excellent transport links to both Boston and Cambridge, making it fantastic for commuting to work. The local area has great amenities including shops, restaurants, bars etc, and a public swimming pool and other sports facilities nearby.
The host Masha and her husband were extremely welcoming and helpful from the moment I arrived in Boston, which was very appreciated given that I was traveling alone and was far from home. They were always on hand if I had questions or needed anything. The apartment is quite spacious, clean and well kept. The kitchen has all the basics needed and the sofa comfortably sleeps a guest if required. The decked area outside was well used by me and makes for a lovely chill out area catching the afternoon sunshine. 
Overall my stay here was fabulous and I would totally recommend this apartment to those looking for somewhere homely to stay while in Boston. Indeed if I am ever back in town I will check out the availability of this place!"

It also has a private washer/dryer for your use in a basement. It is located in a quite residential neighbourhood. Since I was there in November, it was quite chilly in the apartment on a colder days, but Masha kindly provided me with a small heater. Overall, I had a great stay there and I'm glad that I found this apartment for my initial stay in Boston. "

The apartment was clean and the bed very confortable. Masha's husband, Paul, even gave us an extra heater because he thoguth that I was a bit cold (the weather in Boston can be brutal at times). Great value for the money, we will stay here again during our future trips to Boston. Thanks Masha!"
2526773,25210822,2015-01-09,25077446,Mark,"This apartment had everything we needed and was very clean. We would definitely stay there again. We didn't have any issues with the temperature while we were there, and it was an unusually cold spell, even for Boston."

It is located in a good neighborhood in Brighton, near grocery stores, public transportation, and within walking distance to a great coffee shop! Masha and her husband were gracious hosts, and during the epic snowstorms ensured we had everything we needed. They even gave us candles in case the lights went out. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others. "

She provided her contact info upon arrival in case we had any questions. The apartment itself is decently furnished, very spacious, nice bathroom, with a private washer/dryer in the basement. The trains are about 15 minutes away by foot, with some cafes, Starbucks, CVS and some bars/restos along the way (Chestnut Hill Ave).  Bus 86 stop is just up the street from the apt which goes to Harvard station. Overall, a very comfortable stay."
2526773,142508607,2017-04-08,75730267,Andrea,"I stayed in this apartment for three months. Masha is a very kind person and always available, the communication with her was great! She helped me in all my needs.  I was here for a student visiting period at the Boston University and I could not find a better location; the apartment was very good (as described in the photos) and perfect for me. It is equipped with everything needed to stay for a long period. It is located in a very quiet neighborhood (about 30 minutes to BU and about 50 minutes to Boston centre with T-Line).  The staying inside the apartment was great! I definitely suggest this apartment for future visitors! :) Andrea"
2526773,181259486,2017-08-12,13872812,Stacy,I had an amazing time staying at Masha's place. I was there for about three months for my summer internship. The place is equipped with everything I needed to live comfortably. I especially liked how safe the neighborhood was. Transportation to the place I worked (near Kendall MIT) was fast using the bus and then train. I highly recommend her place! Thank you so much Masha for everything.
4860853,28283003,2015-03-21,29272172,Daniel,"For the price and location ($90/night, 10 minute walk from Hynes Convention Center), it was worth the stay. It's a small studio apartment in an older building. The apartment was clean and warm. The walls are not soundproof, so like most low- to mid-range motels you can hear neighbors if they're loud, but it was quiet after 10pm when I stayed. One piece of advice: be sure the electronic door lock is engaged (check from the outside after you leave); if not, flip the switch on the inside."
4860853,28674202,2015-03-28,20692305,Fernando,muy buen barrio  cercano a todo
4860853,29231920,2015-04-05,5324023,Pascale,The appartement was ideally located in the South End area - very cute neighberhood with great restaurants. Perfect for a short stay! 
4860853,31215971,2015-05-03,5094769,Samuel,"Great neighbourhood!!! I came for 3 nights and we basically walked everywhere. The apt was very clean when we arrived and the keyless entry is really great. However, it was smaller than we anticipated, similar to a college dorm-room. Good for 1 person, a bit small for 2 but did the trick nonetheless. Quiet, nice and safe neighbourhood. We got a bit unlucky, as there was construction in an adjacent building. Overall, a good experience in a city with few decent hotels less than $300."
4860853,31530320,2015-05-06,30475783,Chris,"The apartment is in a great part of town (walking distance to many of the sights, inlcuding Fenway Park) and there are a number of good restaruants and bars nearby. The apartment is simple but has everything you would need for a short stay in Boston; and the key-less doors (entry is by number code) make checking-in etc. extremely convenient, no matter what time you intend to arrive."
4860853,31723235,2015-05-09,7535162,Emily,"The building was very quiet and the studio was very simple.  The bed and pillows were maximally comfortable, and the shower worked great.  The area was also perfect for access to Boylston street."
4860853,32520125,2015-05-19,30560699,Toni,The apartment was perfect for my travel needs in a beautiful area of Boston.  It was exactly as advertised.  Thank you.
4860853,32760782,2015-05-21,1577962,Phil,"Brent was very communicative and helpful during the booking process and gave me the information that I needed.

The studio is in a building run by a holding company, they send an email with full details on how to access the building, the room and the wifi details.  All access is via number pad and so you do not need to be there by a specific time as no one needs to let you in, this is very handy when coming on a late flight.

It's located in a great area and you can walk to many of the great things Boston has to offer, the road the studio is on is quiet and the bed is very comfortable (so much so we made a note of the mattress manufacturer).

The apartment we had was very compact, if there are two of you you may find it too much so if you usually need a lot of space.

However if you just need a comfy bed for when you've exhausted yourself from exploring then this is perfect."
4860853,32934874,2015-05-23,33396472,Richard,"The studio was perfect for my stay.  
It had all the important items that I needed such as coffee maker, iron and tv.
The unit was bright and also very quiet.  
There is not a better neighborhood, may restaurants and bars to enjoy after a day at work and all in walking distant.
Thumbs up,
Richard

4860853,33505849,2015-05-29,28970134,Kacper,"This room is one of multiple units that the owner has and rents through a different company with listings on airbnb, it's not a typical airbnb listing; Brent doesn't live here, nor does he live in the same building. 

This being said, it was still a great choice for Boston. The check-in process is very simple; they send you an email with the code for the front door, and the code for your unit. My girlfriend and I arrived, opened the front door, found our unit, and got in. That's it. Overall very simple, very easy. 

The unit was not the one pictured in the listing, but it was basically the same. (Different carpet color, furniture arrangement, etc.). It was quite small, but good enough for two people in Boston.

The room itself: clean, well appointed, but bring some toiletries if you plan on staying for a few days, as they only had one travel sized bottle of shampoo. There is a laundry room in the basement, with two washers, and two dryers that are free, but bring your own detergent. Best part of the listing was the fantastic location. Very handsome brownstone building in an old part of town with similar brownstones and only a five minute walk to Copley Square; Fantastic! If you don't mind the small size and the fact that your renting from a company, this is a fantastic choice. We had a great time. "
4860853,34212049,2015-06-06,31976515,Benjamin,The listing was exactly as described. There was a nice welcome folder that outlined various food and beverage spots in the vicinity of the apartment. The neighbourhood was pleasant and convenient as it is very easy to walk to Mass Ave and Prudential metro stations. 
4860853,36687808,2015-06-30,33043189,Jeff,"The room was as advertised. The neighborhood was nice, and was conveniently located for anyone wanting to travel around Boston. Upon our arrival the room was missing a few items such as the ironing board and hair dryer. Brent was really accommodating however, and had both items delivered to the room within 24 hours. Overall I would recommend this rental. "
4860853,37865747,2015-07-11,14943744,Richard,Brent was on top of things and a great host.  Nice neighborhood and great Studio!
4860853,42420540,2015-08-13,7836502,Ana Maria,Communication wasn't great. You are dealing with a rental company. On the day of the arrival we didn't have the codes to enter the building or unit. They changed the unit at the last minute. The good thing is that we were upgraded to a larger one. The apartment was great with everything you need and the location is wonderful. It was clean and beautifully decorated. We would go back without hesitation. 
4860853,45561573,2015-09-04,18069651,Brandon,The location was very convenient for the places we wanted to go. It's about a 20 minute walk to Fenway which is awesome. Only thing I suggest is to request extra towels before hand. We stayed for 5 days and only received 1 set of towels. I requested free towels after day 3 but did not get them. 
4860853,46174802,2015-09-08,40882938,Morgan,Our experience with Brent was easy from the start. He answered all of our questions in a timely manner. The location on the South End/ Back bay was perfect! It was a beautiful street filled with cafes and restaurants that made us fall in love with Boston! It was the perfect place to stay if you want to feel like a local! It was also just a short walk to all of the wonderful attractions that Boston has to offer. The small studio was just as described in the listing and all that we needed for our stay. The keypad security was incredibly useful as we were driving in late at night and made for easy check in and check out. Overall I would say it was a wonderful experience! 
4860853,50173045,2015-10-10,6272479,Ronald,"The apartment is located in a great location, on a quiet, tree-lined street. My visit was for business purposes, so proximity to the convention center was important - only 10 mins walk from the apartment. Initial communication to book the apartment was harder than it should have been, but once that was pointed out, the team responded quickly. 

The unit was well appointed and clean, although the shower stall could benefit from an upgrade. Those points aside, I would stay here again as an alternative to a hotel."
4860853,66920067,2016-03-25,54543065,Michelle,I received all information needed to make my stay great in a timely manner. 
4860853,72599079,2016-05-03,62302612,John,Place was fantastic and clean. Small quiet room on a beautiful street about a 10 minute walk to the nearest station. Door codes made getting in a breeze and not having to worry about keys during the trip was a plus. Would definitely stay here again!
4860853,72648305,2016-05-04,27767659,Spoyz,"The worst Airbnb ever. Everything may look perfect on website but in fact it was so small and ridiculously poor management.

Arrival:
He checked us in a different room, not this one we booked and paid on Airbnb. The room's calendar said it was available so we processed the booking. He said the room we paid for was not available.

The stay:
We slept for the first night and woke up with panic by the hammer knocking heavily and loudly on the wall above our head in the early morning. The loudness went for many hours. It's clear that the room next door was under construction before we checked in, because a ladder was left in front. Brent never tell us about this before we are here. We tried to text him on message but he never answer until now. So we called up to the apartment's management (because the phone number Brent gave to Airbnb was not exist) and asked for any solution because we booked here 3 nights and we cannot live in this environment. He replied ""There's nothing I can do about this."" and repeated this phase many times. Until I was deciding to call a police because we paid for 3-nights rent here to sleep but we cannot sleep and the host was not willing to solve the problem. Later, he told us to go sleep in other room but we must leave the room before 10am because someone else will be checking in. So we had to walk up the stairs in pyjamas back to our knocking room in the morning after. This is the worst stay I have ever experienced from Airbnb.

The host did not even apologize us or anything to make us feel better. He acted like we stayed here for free. The apartment has 16 rooms in the building, so we aware when you book a place in Boston. Don't come here."
4860853,76927965,2016-05-29,3016298,Jody,"The property is just as it looks in the pictures: sunny, new, clean, small. The building is classic Boston brownstone and the street is beautiful: a narrow boulevard with a tree row running down the middle. The location is excellent with cafes, restaurants, pubs and clubs nearby. Not as great for shopping but Newbury St isn't too far away and an Orange line T stop is maybe a 10 minute walk. If you have a car you definitely want to add the optional parking space cuz you won't easily find street parking."
4860853,150876866,2017-05-09,98593876,Vladi,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15246509,108545199,2016-10-16,27162573,Sam,"Tanya made us feel very welcome in her home. She left us plenty of towels and bedding for my friends and me and even provided amenities like q-tips and makeup removing wipes in the bathrooms. The space itself is beautiful and spacious; my party of five fit quite comfortably. Back Bay is an awesome location for its close proximity to shopping and amazing restaurants, so we were able to walk everywhere from the apartment. 

When we checked in, we had a little bit of difficulty getting into the building and Tanya answered our phone call right away to help us get inside. Tanya's apartment in Back Bay truly is a hidden gem in Boston!"
15246509,109287683,2016-10-20,98847760,Patrick,The apartment was super clean and nice. Right in the middle of everything you could want to do in Boston.  Tanya was a great host and was super responsive regarding any questions we had.  Having toiletries and snacks available when we arrived was a nice touch as well.
15246509,110474903,2016-10-26,12909442,Jonas,"Tanya was extremely quick on replies and made my co-worker and me feel very comfortable. From the additional emails prior to our stay telling us how to gain access to the continual communication throughout our stay - our host was excellent. Perfect location, clean, great beds, breakfast bars and chocolates available, all the amenities you need. A former guest appears to have taken Tanya's awesome Nespresso machine so she had a French Press delivered same day. I'm sorry that happened to her, but the quick response and action is to be commended. I'm now hooked on French Press coffee. I can't wait to return."
15246509,112026867,2016-11-03,65392504,David,"The pace was simply awesome. Beautiful, full equipped and very comfortable. The area is very safe and you can walk at anytime. Close to restaurants and bars. If I go back to Boston definitely I would go back to Tanya's place"
15246509,112167451,2016-11-04,98483729,Tyler,"Great place! Our stay was short, but well worth it. I'd definitely recommend it."
15246509,114072421,2016-11-15,98658022,Janine,The neighborhood was fantastic! Easy walking to shops and restaurants. Always felt safe and the area was beautiful 
15246509,114841334,2016-11-20,24730979,Sarah,The apartment was clean and nice. It was also in a safe location and close to a lot of great restaurants and cafes on Newbury street as well as the Copley T station. We had no problem with the apartment itself but the lockbox was a bit tricky to open. Other than that we had a great time.
15246509,115197916,2016-11-22,17236686,Cherie,The neighborhood was in a perfect location.  We enjoyed our stay.
15246509,115996943,2016-11-27,2023179,Ann,"Lovely, spacious apartment in an excellent Back Bay location. Easily walkable to many great shops, restaurants and public transport. Communication with our host was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. "
15246509,117217348,2016-12-05,23147948,Fabio,"Grosse, schöne Wohnung an ausgezeichneter Lage. Tanya ist ein sehr guter Host und stand uns jederzeit für Fragen zur Verfügung. Ist definitiv weiterzuempfehlen! Ich würde jedenfalls wiederkommen!"
15246509,123080293,2016-12-27,22413547,Pm,"The apartment is very spacious and in a great location. We spent 3 weeks there in December and on many days it was great.

Unfortunately the apartment just above is a large AirBnB for 8 guests and we had a few nights where large groups were having parties and it was extremely noisy. The host did talk to other host but it didn't help much.

The apartment itself is large and well equipped. It's a pity because, the interior is pretty old and run down (very old bathrooms, closets, cupboards, etc). With a little bit of renovation this place would be spectacular. The cleaning crew didn't do a great job cleaning the place before we arrived (e.g. Pans and dishes were dirty, layers of dust on the fridge)."
15246509,123508344,2016-12-29,40779364,Cara,"This is a beautiful apartment and a great location in Boston. Close to Subway. There are stairs into the apartment  so definitely not for someone with mobility issues. The apartment is very airy....and well stocked. I highly recommend if you wish to tour Boston

15246509,124704489,2017-01-02,3307012,Asia,Amazing spacious brownstone in the best part of town! Definitely would recommend it to my friends 
15246509,127035746,2017-01-15,91525149,Grant,Great place in a great area! 
15246509,130079794,2017-02-04,101897298,Jaime,"Home as described very clean and comfortable. Would recommend to anyone traveling for business but not to families since neighbors complain about walking around after nine (met neighbors as we arrived, planed?). "
15246509,130805988,2017-02-08,105551835,Si Si,Great experiences of my family staying in the apartment. Excellent location and super fast response and services from Tanya(the host) on any requests. Really worthy for money. 
15246509,133430030,2017-02-22,71200111,Genevieve,"I stayed at this Airbnb with a colleague while visiting Boston for business purposes. The apartment itself is older than it would seem from the photos. It's a spacious apartment with full kitchen amenities (although only a small french press, no coffee maker). We felt lucky to find a 2-br/1.5-ba place in the area, and it was in walking distance (a few blocks) of restaurants, etc. However, we could clearly hear the neighbors upstairs (fortunately no parties, as other reviewers experienced). There were also broken blinds in both bedrooms, dead lightbulbs in the hallway (so no easy light to turn on if you arrive at night), and apparently a prior tenant had taken the iron (Tanya ordered an adorable little travel iron, although it arrived late in our stay). Overall, the apartment itself could use some love, but it is centrally located, and has most of the amenities needed for a business trip to the Boston area."
15246509,134480767,2017-02-27,109849301,Siobhan,Tanya was a great host. Had a bit of trouble getting connected to the wifi and texted Tanya and she fixed it straight away. 
15246509,136108645,2017-03-08,61701584,Sharmeen,This apartment is in the best location ever. Tanya was very easy to deal with. 
15246509,136919755,2017-03-12,82338166,Jason,"Only issue we had overall is we felt on edge a lot just because of the rules being so strict. 100 dollars a scratch was very worrisome and under no circumstances to move furniture and all that. We just felt a little on edge that made the experience a little less than perfect. It is also fair to say that we agreed to those rules when we rented the apartment so that is less on the owner in my opinions as it's her property and she can choose any rules she wants, that's her right. But besides that factor she was polite and had great communication, apartment was great, clean, and as described in a great location. Overall it was a good experience and a good price and she was a great landlord. I would recommend this apartment to anyone that is looking to experience Boston and to have a quiet relaxing time!! "
15246509,137285972,2017-03-14,83531365,Hollie,Large apartment.  Great location & Tanya is on hand if you need her.

15246509,140244257,2017-03-28,33986606,Shaughna,"4 of us stayed in Tanya's lovely apartment and we had an amazing time. The apartment is ideally located, very central but in a quiet safe neighbourhood at the same time. We still can't believe how great location is. Walking distance to a lot of the main parts of the city. Tanya provided all the essentials, was great at communicating. We never actually met her, but she provided clear instructions and was always on hand to answer questions. She recommended some restaurants and shops for us to try and they were all great! If you're interested in breakfast, the paramount or Thorntons are within 10-15 minutes walking distance. We really enjoyed eating at both of them. Apartment was very clean and check in was super easy. We'd definitely stay there again, would highly recommend to anyone looking to visit Boston. "
15246509,140937829,2017-04-01,120489580,Aaron,Great location. 3rd floor without an elevator. 
15246509,142338926,2017-04-07,106711005,Jordi,Everything was perfect and smooth. I highly appreciate the flexibility of Tanya to adapt to our early check in.

15246509,145493760,2017-04-18,69648818,William,"This is a nice apartment in a great location!  Having two bathrooms made this property nice for our group of four people.  The kitchen and main room are spacious, and everything is in good condition.  The host was accommodating and responsive to our questions.  We enjoyed our stay at this apartment! "
15246509,146385516,2017-04-22,59569158,Ailish,"Me and my parents had a great time in Boston staying in Tanya's apartment. The location was what was most impressive for us, it was in a beautiful area and was within walking distance to everything. The apartment itself was spacious and comfortable and had a good range of appliances. The only issues we found during our stay was the noise levels. In the apartment you can hear quite clearly the noise from the apartment upstairs. Also the fridge in the kitchen would make a strange noise for about 15-20 minutes at a time which was a bit unpleasant. Otherwise our stay was great. "
15246509,147979506,2017-04-29,6214481,Ellen,We loved the location and the spacious rooms.  The bathrooms needs an update. The contact with tanya was easy and fast. Great place to stay! We can highly recommend this.
15246509,148896156,2017-05-01,23143935,Eva,"Tanya was super flexible, totally available and incredibly kind. It was a pleasure to stay at her place, which is located in a lovely neighborhood, walking-distant from the most important attractions of Boston!"
15246509,152588177,2017-05-17,118268217,Susan,Great location. Able to walk most anywhere.  Place worked out great for us!

15246509,156922917,2017-06-01,126011989,Melissa,"Fantastic location. Perfect jumping off point for tons of city adventures. Close to shopping, food and train. Large and spacious apartment with ample room for two adults and three teenagers. Two bathrooms a definite plus. Some parts of the apartment are dated, but the kitchen has been recently updated and the furnishings are modern and comfortable."
15246509,158774215,2017-06-08,21984575,Ryan,"the location is great and that is basically what you are paying for. the place is not kept up and is very sparse with furniture. the lighting doesn't work at all so she put a floor lamp in the living room and each bedroom. the lighting situation is equivalent to having a couple candles. felt like i was camping the whole time i was there.

the major negative for me though was how unwelcoming this place felt. tanya will send you an email before you arrive that outlines all the possible charges she could ding you for plus some extremely restrictive quiet hours. i have slept on friends couches that had more of an accommodating feel. i would not recommend staying here if it is important to you to feel you have a ""home base"" while you travel. for me, it definitely ruined my trip a bit not to feel welcome and comfortable at the place.

overall, i would recommend people to look elsewhere for accommodation. this place is way too expensive for what you get and there are comparable places in the area that are better. this is a classic example of an airbnb that sole purpose is to generate revenue with no regard to experience or being accommodating. "
15246509,162124909,2017-06-19,92443229,Jennifer, Great location very cute place… Had a great time 
15246509,163296764,2017-06-24,34513520,Heidi,"Very disappointed at both the apartment and the host. I think the view of the host is that location trumps everything and this is not the case! Not only was the apartment smelly and not properly cleaned it has also not been maintained and is in bad condition with fused lights, broken blinds, terrible bathrooms ( I showered in my flip flops) but the host doesn't seem to care about the feedback and never contacted me back after registering my initial concerns with her and her only response being her regular cleaner did not clean the flat? After a number of other lovely stays in the USA this trip this one was the worst. Avoid it,"
15246509,168061231,2017-07-08,15914463,Josh,"I'm one of three people on a distributed team in a startup and we were looking for a place where we could all meet in person and brainstorm together for a couple of days. In that sense, Tanya's place worked out pretty nicely. We had a large common area with nice lighting, a clean apartment, and a fantastic area. One night for dinner we took a 15-minute walk to Mario Batali's Eataly, and it was really lovely.

On the downside, the blinds were damaged when we got there, which meant that one of the bedrooms became very bright at 5am with no real relief. That was a bummer. We also experienced a leak in the ceiling and the building repairman had to come. Finally, the policies felt a bit strict so one doesn't get the warm and fuzzies.

But all of that is correctable, and to her credit, Tanya was very responsive."

15246509,187739156,2017-08-27,65097293,Leah,I decided to rent out Tanya's place for a quick trip to Boston for the Kenny Chesney concert. I wanted to be close to the city so that I could sightsee a couple of days prior to the concert on Saturday. Tanya was very quick to respond and her organization was very helpful with checking in and out. Her place is a beautiful and quaint historic brownstone in an amazing location just blocks away from Newberry street. Staying here made it so accessible to walk around the city!!
17573922,138933119,2017-03-22,39983954,Cecilia,Billy is a good host . Very responsive and helpful. The apartment is amazing location is perfect. Very well equipped.

17573922,144117217,2017-04-14,124797813,Christopher,It's great place me and my girlfriend enjoyed. Close to Boston Chinatown and can get everything you need by walking. Nice place to stay in if you visiting Boston.

17573922,147990945,2017-04-29,119559450,Andrew,"Billy is quick to respond and provide any assistance if needed. He is open to suggestions and tries hard to make your stay great. Check-in is effortless with digital keyless entry. Neighbourhood and building feel safe. 20 min walk to convention centre. Clean with comfortable bed. Fully equipped with kitchen supplies, ironing supplies and hair dryer. Fast wifi and cable TV. Would stay here again."
17573922,149270817,2017-05-03,122717401,Nina,The location is really convenient and Billy gave me really detail information about finding his place! 
17573922,150179175,2017-05-07,74814648,Kianna,"Place is exactly like the pictures and a comfortable walking distance to downtown Boston and Chinatown. Billy responded quickly to any questions, making our stay even more pleasant. Would definitely recommend staying here! "

17573922,153652409,2017-05-21,4370632,Viva And Robert,The apartment was clean and well-equipped. Instructions for getting in were clear and the host was very responsive when we contacted him. This is a good choice for an affordable stay in Boston with space for multiple people.
17573922,156182978,2017-05-29,2383163,Annie,"This apartment is immaculately clean and organized. The space is true to pictures, very modern, and has a hotel-like feel. Our host was very communicative beforehand - gave us all the instructions for getting in and out of the apartment (keypad entrance - no keys to deal with, which we loved) well ahead of time. Wifi is excellent. Coffee maker was nice. Overall, would definitely recommend. "
17573922,159809197,2017-06-11,118809528,Ben,"Billy was very accommodating and an excellent host. The unit was very clean and exactly as advertised. I would highly recommend the location while visiting Boston. As someone that lived in a large city, and is used to it being noisy at night, this apartment was tucked away on a quiet side street, which lends itself to more comfortable sleep. Everything is within walking distance, and it made the logistics of my stay stress free. If I ever visit Boston again, I'll be sure to look at the availability of this unit. "
17573922,161035402,2017-06-16,12101026,Nancy,"Billy was great - very responsive & helpful, although we didn't meet him in person. The place was just as described! "
17573922,163386118,2017-06-24,129114662,Lan,"I stayed at Billy's apartment for 3 nights with my family. His apartment was absolutely amazing! It was at the heart of China town, super clean inside and closed to downtown Boston. Billy is a fantastic host!!! He replies to my text super fast. Billy is so kind. He also let us put our luggages at his place a bit late after the checkout time while waiting for the bus. We enjoy our trip a lot! Thanks Billy ❤️"
17573922,165039558,2017-06-30,125828206,Thomas,"Billy est un hôte sympathique et très réactif pour vous aider si vous avez le moindre problème.
L'appartement est très propre et bien situé mais il n'est pas très bien isolé de l'appartement du dessus (aussi location AirBnb) dont les locataires peuvent s'avérer bruyants.
"
17573922,166102567,2017-07-02,30932298,Alexandra,"I was going to not do self-checking again after a not so great experience, but Billy showed me that it is more a question of host than process. We never met him but we felt welcome, and helped when needed (a medical emergency). 

We loved how clean the appartment was, the location with good restaurants, a playground and the green way which is such a great way to walk the city and the calm."
17573922,167097065,2017-07-05,31621952,Steve,"Very nice and clean apartment. Centrally located and only a walking distance to a lot of Boston attraction.

Would definitely recommend this apartment to others."
17573922,168540170,2017-07-09,819921,Justin,"This is a great listing, right in the middle of Boston and close to everything.

It sure doesn't look like much from the outside -- approaching from the street, it looks like another run-down, dated Boston property. You'd never think twice about it, walking by. But what a shock when you get inside. Everything is brand new, modern, high quality, and in perfect condition. And clean. I've checked into clean AirBnB properties before, but not like this. I mean, it's really incredible.

It's also very quiet in the evening, which was a pleasant surprise.

The location can't be beat. You're right where you want to be for anything in the middle of the city. Grocery stores and other amenities are very close.

The only negative thing I can think of is that parking (in any of the nearby lots) is so expensive. But what can anyone do about that? Welcome to Boston, I guess. But if you're bringing your care, be prepared to pay $30 per night in any of the nearby lots (unless you find a deal better than the ones I found).

Definitely recommended."
17573922,172055772,2017-07-19,124617267,Dana,Apt. Is as shown. Neiggborhood 'kitchie' fun and safe.loved having our iwn quiet retreat after long days if business meetings.  Very clean and modern. Thank you for your quick response to emails. Won't hesitate to return!

I would highly recommend him and his place to anyone and would love to stay in Boston again at this awesome spot.
17573922,175755272,2017-07-29,120655293,Gorance,"Definitely recommend Billy's place to anyone who wants to stay in Boston. It's walkable distance to everything. Billy was a great host, the place was clean, organised and had everything you needed.  "

17573922,178089814,2017-08-04,113611038,Kimberly,Billy's apartment is a hidden gem. You would not expect to find such a nice apartment from the exterior. It is nicely renovated and clean. The entrance could be easily overlooked but we had no issues finding it thanks to the clear and detailed instructions. The location is convenient and central to everything. All the amenities provided made us feel like we were staying at a hotel. Billy is very quick to respond and pleasant to communicate with. He is also very accommodating with our luggage. I would definitely recommend staying at Billy's apartment!
17573922,179451961,2017-08-07,21023239,Michelle,"Billy is an unbelievable host. He makes the process incredibly seamless and easy. Additionally, he is so detailed oriented that it makes for quite the airbnb experience. Everything from the instaneious responses to all my questions to the notebook that all guests can sign to the blow dryer and shampoo/conditioner, the water, etc.  I have to say, Billy's place is better than a hotel and would stay again without a question. 

The location of the airbnb is in Chinatown but is so close to everything. This makes it a great location to tour the city. 

Thank you Billy!"
17573922,180570983,2017-08-10,42458443,Belinda,We would highly recommend Billy's apartment for any stay in Boston. Billy's detailed instructions were right on the mark and her communication throughout our stay was excellent.
17573922,182452462,2017-08-14,131585187,Kevin,"Thanks Billy for allowing us to stay at 63HS. The apartment was all we needed for a 4 night visit to Boston. We were able to walk everywhere and enjoyed our time there. Chinatown, Downtown Crossing, Boston Common, Beacon Hill, Mass General, Long Wharf, Quincy Markets, Little Italy, Hatbourfront...on foot . Proximity to South Station a bonus!"
17573922,192599447,2017-09-10,47793555,Sue Ching,"Billy was very courteous and is quick to response. He even allowed us to leave our luggage bag at the place past check out time, which was really helpful for our travel. The place was very clean, comfortable and was very central. The kitchen and bathroom were very well equiped. I fully recommend anyone stopping by Boston to stay here."

17573922,198186825,2017-09-28,4728994,Yost,"Billy's place is centrally located so you can walk or take the T, close to Boston Common area and Chinatown.  Kitchen has everything you need, electric kettle, coffee maker, etc.  For a diner style breakfast, try Southside diner- within walking distance. Billy was great to work with - very accommodating after ""my"" mix up with our reservation."
17573922,199318369,2017-10-01,56098922,Rachel,"Billy’s place is a lovely apartment, easily accessible, clean, accurate to the description, comfy, and a nice place to call “home” for a few days in Boston!"
8116523,46080158,2015-09-07,41902647,Matt,"Although I did not get to meet Frank in person, he was very quick to respond to my questions, very friendly, and did an amazing job making sure we had all the accommodations we needed. I did get a chance to meet Frank's brother and he was also incredibly kind and gave us some great recommendations for activities to do in the the city. 

The condo was very nice. It was in an amazing neighborhood on the bottom floor (partially underground, which was cool) of a very nice complex, it was quiet and extremely clean. Very convenient walk to Newbury Street, the Public Garden, Fenway Park, and  Downtown Boston. This place is very well priced for the neighborhood it is in and I would highly recommended staying here. Next time I am in Boston, I am definitely going to book with Frank. "
8116523,47522138,2015-09-20,23579653,Tucker,"Had an excellent stay here!  Apartment was clean and very spacious.  Location allowed for easy access to anything you need by way of foot, or Uber/train if venturing further.  Would absolutely recommend staying here, and will likely try and do so again myself in the future!"
8116523,48311380,2015-09-25,43119009,Stephanie,"Location was absolutely perfect! We walked everywhere in Boston - Cambridge, North End, Waterfront - you name it, we walked there.  Cozy little place with just enough space for 2 people - we were rarely there anyway with so much to see in Boston. I never saw Frank, but met his Brother & handyman - nice people and always great response when we needed it.  I definitely recommend! "
8116523,48911015,2015-09-29,26629277,LaNae,"For using airbnb for the first time, Frank made it so easy for us! He made sure we were well taken care off and had a quick response time to any questions we had! The location/size of his place was absolutely perfect and I would recommend staying there to everyone! "
8116523,49057631,2015-09-30,31635092,Jessica,"Frank was very welcoming and responsive to questions.  It was a smooth process from reservation to checkout and I really liked the place.  The apartment is very conveniently located in a coveted, quiet neighborhood, as described.  I would definitely stay here again."
8116523,49247407,2015-10-02,43278961,Ben,"Apartment was in a good location, was clean and as described. Check in was painless as Frank provided a key code. Free WiFi and use of Amazon Prime was a bonus"
8116523,49831568,2015-10-06,12753162,Danlei,"Location is perfect. When I went there, one guy who was living 20 years ago in this building came to revisiting.  He stood in front of the building and told me his stories with deep emotions. Lovely. Frank is very helpful for answering questions to support so much. "
8116523,50007108,2015-10-08,44025565,Tim,"Very nice one bedroom garden apartment in a perfect Back Bay location.  Linens were top notch.  Easy check-in and out.  Would definatey book again.  Thank you, Frank!"
8116523,50490042,2015-10-12,21604533,John,"Exactly as described, with all the amenities one could need. Host was communicative and made access to the unit painless and simple. The unit was inviting and offered a great perspective of the city, with quick access to many sights and a great neighborhood."

8116523,51646989,2015-10-22,26351750,Christopher,The apartment was exactly as described in the listing with a great central location.  Frank made it a very easy and simple process and was extremely responsive and helpful.  Would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Boston and will be doing so the next time I visit.
8116523,52231208,2015-10-27,5199537,Genesa,"The flat is in a great location in Back Bay. Very easy to walk to shops abs dining and also the river. 

The flat is comfortable and stylish and a nice place to stay. 

We had one issue when we arrived that the second bed was not set up. Frank was responsive and able to get someone to come and set it up but it did take some time so I recommend you inform him before your arrival if you need to have a second bed in the unit for your stay. 

I would definitely stay again at this place. "
8116523,52360985,2015-10-28,46653672,Roy,Overall the neighborhood was nice and the description was very accurate. Definitely a nice place and would gladly stay there again.
8116523,53136547,2015-11-05,26083546,Michael,"Stayed one night in this great location! Safe place great walking distance from shops and the commons! 

Will be staying here again!"
8116523,53209797,2015-11-06,11871118,Matt,Frank made my trip extremely convenient by having the house instructions ready for me in a timely manner describing exactly how to get in the the house. Everything was as described. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and I had a perfect night's sleep. Very centrally located. 
8116523,53628157,2015-11-10,41107373,Tina,"The lodging at 189 Beacon Street was a great location for anyone wanting to tour the city on foot! It is the perfect location to stay in Boston and this little apartment was so cute. It offers everything you need to stay comfortably with a great full kitchen, living room, full bath and bedroom with a full size bed. There were a couple of things that had not been mentioned in any previous reviews that I will mention and may only be personal preference.

1. The apartment is the basement of the brownstone and at night when we were trying to sleep in the bedroom we could here people walking around upstairs until after 1am. In addition  we could also hear muffled conversations through the ceiling. (As far as any noise from the street that was very minimal and very tolerable).

2. The bedroom's bed linens were beautiful, but made from microfiber which can be very sweaty at night, but I think that's just personal preference.

3. The cot that is offered is not very comfortable to sleep on.

4. There was a slight sewer smell in the basement apartment.

Overall, I would probably stay again, but if there was another bedroom in this area at a lower rate I would stay there instead. 
"
8116523,53715496,2015-11-11,47898443,Ellen,"This was an amazing experience.  The location was so close to everything but yet the neighborhood friendly & quiet.  Frank was really quick responding to any email and we felt very lucky to have found this place.  Also, the beds were really comfy & the apartment was well appointed and really decorated nicely. I  would definitely recommend this place!  Ellen"
8116523,54266156,2015-11-17,40441825,Andrea,"Staying at Frank's Brownstone in Back Bay was a great experience for my boyfriend and I. The town was so beautiful to look at and there was a lot of stores and things to do in the area. I highly recommend Frank's apartment over a hotel any day because it makes you feel at home and on vacation at the same time. The back bay common garage, where I parked my car, was only 12 minutes away by walking and I thought the rates were fair and cheaper than NYC. I hope to rent this apartment again in the future because a few days in Boston isn't enough time to see and do everything you want. Frank's apartment had clean linen and towels and had everything we needed. Overall I had a great stay and I'm sure Frank's future guests will also have a great experience as well."
8116523,54521554,2015-11-21,13831260,Uri,"The apartment is just as advertised. It is in a great neighborhood and was within walking distance to everything. 

Thanks again for a great stay! "
8116523,54866278,2015-11-25,20107175,Howard,"Frank was a great host. He has a nice place and it's in a great location and close to Newbury Street, restaurants and stores. It was very clean and had everything you need. The bedroom is small and the bed is comfortable but you can only get into it from one side unless you climb over. There was a damp smell I think from being part on the lower level but it was fine. Overall it's a great place to stay!"
8116523,54947995,2015-11-25,12614753,Sean,"Loved this apartment! It was bright, clean and spacious. Very close to so many shops, restaurants and bars. Would love to come back!"
8116523,55423304,2015-12-01,40069297,Erin,"We stayed here for over Thanksgiving break and just loved it. Franklin was extremely helpful and very communicative with any questions we had. This was our first experience with AirBnB and we will definitely use Franklin again when we are in Boston. The property was in a perfect location. Close to shops, eateries, and transportation.  Quiet sleeps at night and very safe location. "

8116523,56007005,2015-12-07,9738183,Nick,"Summary: nice host, great location, good quality furniture/decor/amenities, terrible smell

I stayed in Frank's place with 2 friends and we fit comfortably. One in the full bed, one on the twin cot, one on the couch. You could fit another in the bed if you're okay getting cozy.

It was very easy to get in and out. Frank gave us a code, which unlocked a box containing keys. He was very responsive with questions, and made an extra effort to help us when we lost a watch.

The street is a main avenue with high traffic but all residential housing. Sound at night was not an issue. Parking was somewhat difficult.

The apt is a basement unit. It has a separate entrance a few steps below the front entrance. Sunlight was fine. But the smell... The apt was dank and smelled like a sewer. The odor is noticeable as soon as you enter and Frank's scented sticks didn't totally cut it.

As I understood, the apt had access to a patio. It does not.

Would I return? Only if the smell was gone. Would I go to Frank if he had another place? Yes."
8116523,56535708,2015-12-14,7599865,Raegan,The apartment is very cozy and exactly as listed.  Frank helped me do a last minute extension when my plans changed and everything was easy from start to finish.  
8116523,57160485,2015-12-22,855723,Bridget,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed for a week, and we would not stay there again. The unit is EXTREMELY inaccurately represented in the listing. The listing describes a one-bedroom apartment with ""access to the entire unit, including bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, dining area, living room, and private patio."" The unit is actually the size of a studio. There is one main room that has a two-person couch, TV, and a kitchen area with bar stools next to the kitchen counter (there is no kitchen table). There are glass doors (not at all sound-proof) between this room and a ""bedroom"" that barely squeezes in a full-sized bed. There is no patio. The listing states there is a ""well-stocked chef's kitchen""- the kitchen is TINY and was not even equipped to cook the pasta and jar of sauce we brought with us, as the only pot in the entire kitchen could hold about 2 cups of water. The listing describes (in two places) a spare queen bed that can be set up in the living room upon request- my husband and I were planning to sleep on this as we had to work late and leave early several times (our daughter was going to sleep in the bedroom). Prior to our arrival, we specifically asked the owner, ""to set up the extra queen bed for us,"" and we were told this would happen. When we arrived, the bed had not been set up as promised. When someone finally came to do it for us on our second day, it turned out the spare bed is actually a TWIN bed, so my husband and I couldn't fit on it, ruining our sleeping plans. The ability to use the living room as our bedroom was part of the reason we chose the apartment in the first place. The owner told me that this part of the listing will be corrected, so hopefully that will happen soon. We would absolutely not have stayed here if we had a clearer picture of what to expect. "
8116523,58190567,2016-01-01,12734370,John,"The location was great.  The pictures were accurate.  The basement unit is small, but have everything one needs for 2-3 people.  The cleanliness was just ok.  The internet did not work and was an essential part of our stay, so, having given a day to resolve the problem, we had to vacate after the 1st night of a 5 night stay.  The Host refused to refund the unused nights, but Airbnb got involved and forced a refund.  If everything goes well during your stay, you will be fine. If not, good luck..."
8116523,58682718,2016-01-03,8992000,Addy,"Frank responded to all of our messages extremely quickly and was very patient when we were having problems with the Internet. He was a great, helpful host and the apartment is very nice. Great location."
8116523,60166417,2016-01-19,53967713,Elliot,"Overall great experience staying at Frank’s place for a weekend. The place was just as described and was a sweet little refuge from the cold weather and wet snow outside. Not to mention, great location! My girlfriend and I had a great stay. 

And if you have a severe anxiety issue with bed linen and towel cleanliness as I do, this place gets a big thumbs up!

Pro tip: Try the chocolate store around the corner for a saweeeet chocolate mocha"
8116523,60343421,2016-01-22,11468784,Carolyn,This listing was absolutely beautiful and my friend and I loved staying in this apartment. The directions and accommodations were very clearly described to us making it a breeze to enjoy. Would recommend this listing to anyone!
8116523,60903010,2016-01-29,28102337,Jon,"I thoroughly enjoyed my two-night stay at Frank's place. First the location is ideal being on a residential part of Beacon with a very short walk to excellent coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and points of interest. The apartment itself is very comfortable and has great charm precisely as described. Frank had fast and friendly communication throughout the process and could not have been better to deal with. Next time I find myself in Boston I'm definitely going to start my accommodation search with this listing... top notch!"
8116523,61183390,2016-02-01,24563793,Nancy,The place was great! The bed was super comfortable. An extra bed came in handy. You are close to everything! No complains at all. Would visit again! Thank you Frank!
8116523,61854043,2016-02-08,57171039,Tom,"Thank you Frank, The apartment was very nice, with lovely decor and a homely feel. The location is great, in a lovely neighbourhood just a short walk to the common and all the shop and restaurants around Newbury st.  Frank was very quick to respond and helpful with his emails. Next time I'm in Boston I will look here first. "
8116523,62905405,2016-02-18,17053356,Sherry,"The host Frank was extremely responsive and helpful to any of our questions and provided equally great accommodations for our 3 night stay in Boston.  Logistically speaking, it was convenient to just about everything.   The actual space was perfect for our needs and provided that comfy cozy home away from home feel hard to find in a hotel room.  Will definitely be returning again. "
8116523,63932956,2016-02-28,57436487,Monica,"The apartment was great and it was just as described, a bit small, but very cozy and comfortable. Location is also great in a very nice neighborhood and close to different restaurants, coffee places, shops and other points of interest. Frank is a great host and he made everything go very easy with the process and was also very responsive. Overall i enjoyed staying here and i would definitely recommend it."

8116523,64896530,2016-03-08,5971101,Grégory,The location is nice and quiet! A good place to enjoy the center of Boston easily!
8116523,65478235,2016-03-14,61400405,Nete,"Exceptional host! Awesome place! If you want a true, authentic Boston experience that is the home to stay. Right in Back Bay, beautiful brownstone building, tree lined street - doesnt get any more old Boston then that. Quiet, cozy and comfortable. This charming apartment is all those things. High ceilings, warm lighting, heavenly mattress. Perfect for catching up on sleep or a romantic getaway. Walk to Boston Common park or down Newbury street, take it a little further into South End or Beacon Hill. Everything is just minutes away.  Definitely reaching out to Frank when planning my next trip to the Bean."
8116523,65723725,2016-03-16,13680779,Barbara,"Beautiful, clean space. Fantastic area. Walking distance to lots of great restaurants!! We were so impressed we spent a couple minutes day dreaming and looking at similar apartments for sale in the neighborhood. 10/10"
8116523,65870229,2016-03-17,34528128,Veronika,Frank was a perfect and willing host. It was a pleasure to stay in his apartment. The communication was very fast. I can definitely recommend!
8116523,65890087,2016-03-17,53095119,Marisa,Frank was just a phone call away! The photos and description of the apartment are accurate and it's placement in the city is great for exploring. Beacon street is beautiful and very safe. Definitely a place to stay again if I'm the city on business.
8116523,66185813,2016-03-20,32196697,Heather,"We had a great experience at Frank's place. He went out of his way before our trip to provide recommendations for local dining/drinking and continued to check in with us to ensure we were settled and happy with the accommodations. The neighborhood couldn't be more beautiful. It was convenient to everything. The block is quiet and the unit is exactly as advertised. We found it to be very clean and comfortable and it contained everything we needed during our stay. We did run into a small snag with the wifi at one point, but this was quickly resolved by Frank. There is a wee bit of a smell being on the garden level, kind of a must, but it dissipates once you're in the unit and we only really noticed it when we first walked in after being out for a bit, so I don't consider it a major issue. This is a wonderful hideaway in Boston and I highly recommend it! If I ever go back, I'll definitely stay here again. It has all the modern conveniences you could want, while also have a very cool factor in terms of the space and neighborhood.  Also, there were three adults in our group and I slept on the blow up mattress, which was a very nice one (tall and with extra cushion) and the linens were perfect. Super cozy blankets for cuddling up and watching HBO on the big TV! Thanks so much, Frank!"
8116523,66798452,2016-03-24,25399512,Christina,"My husband and I absolutely loved Frank's home! Perfect location! The building is lovely and apartment was warm and welcoming. We will definitely visit again soon!

8116523,67974278,2016-04-01,62518115,Jenny,"This is my first time using airbnb and I am so glad that I chose Frank's brownstone. The location is convenient (a few minutes walk to the Public Garden, the Esplanade, Chinatown, Copley, Newbury Street, Public Transportation, and great restaurants!). Frank was very kind and made sure to check in on us before we arrived. His place was exactly as described and looked like the pictures listed. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked, and most importantly, the home was clean and spotless! I would highly recommend Frank's brownstone to anyone visiting Boston. Thank you again Frank! I can't wait to stay with you again. "
8116523,68710792,2016-04-06,33197331,Erika,"The apartment was as described- a cozy 1  bedroom.  
It was clean and Frank was a good host.  He stayed in touch during my brief stay to make sure that everything was OK.  
The neighborhood is lovely - peaceful yet convenient.  I was able to go to 2 gorgeous parks and walk to the T.  There is also shopping and restaurants nearby.  
Unfortunately I'm not able to give 4-5 stars because there was an unpleasant odor the whole time I was there.  It was dank, musty, and strong.  If that gets resolved, then I would be able to recommend the place.  
"
8116523,69010963,2016-04-08,59381879,Kate,Frank was a fantastic host. His apartment is clean and neat and has everything you'd need. It's in the very best part of the back bay in Boston in one of the original brown stones. I'd stay here over and over again.

Muito bem localizado 
Recomendo "
8116523,73878309,2016-05-11,252679,Patti,"Such a sweet little apt in a primo location.  Lots of towels, blankets, pillows. Plus toiletries.  I loved the exposed brick and high ceilings in this street level apt.  Easy access to keys via lock box.  I never met Frank but he was very communicative. I wish I had more than one night.  Perhaps next time I am in Boston. Thanks again!"
8116523,75662395,2016-05-22,22297288,Patrick,"My girlfriend and I booked Frank's place for a long weekend get away and we enjoyed thoroughly,thanks to Frank's beautiful apartment. It was extremely clean and had great tips of local attractions as well as great directions for the apartment. We parked our car Thursday morning and didn't touch it until Sunday afternoon, it is in the ideal location, with the ability to walk almost everywhere. We will definitely look to stay here again next time we travel to Boston! "
8116523,75917496,2016-05-23,43516206,Chase,"Frank was a great host and the unit was extremely conveniently located for access to Back Bay, Fenway, and Cambridge - all within walking distance.  My wife and I enjoyed our 1-year anniversary in the home and it offered coziness as-advertised.  Would use Frank again."
8116523,76192334,2016-05-25,43217296,Eric,Frank's place is nice and as described. It is cry closed to Boston common and the beautiful Charles river. Frank us also very responsive from day 1 making our stay easy and pleasant!

8116523,80693200,2016-06-19,66235810,Greg,"We were looking for a local taste on our latest trip to Boston and that is exactly what we got with this listing. The location is excellent not far from great walking parks and the bustling Newbury St where you can find everything from sidewalk cafes to fine dining and all kinds of stores. The interior was very cozy, clean and comfortable. The exterior (entrance) of the place could use some clean up however as it seems some birds have nested high above the door and leave a mess down below just as you come and go from the place. The surrounding buildings also have their nice flower gardens and gates which this one could use. However these are just a couple aesthetic observances but it is still an excellent place to experience all that the Back Bay has to offer. I would definitely recommend it to others. "
8116523,86559498,2016-07-17,64169130,Noel,"Very nice place as described. The location was so convenient for getting to the local sights, shopping, and transportation. Very walkable. The beautiful Charles River Esplanade, Boston Public Garden, and Boston Common are only blocks away. 

Frank was very responsive to any questions I had. The extra bed was set up and ready as requested in advance of our arrival. Plenty of extra towels and sheets were available if needed. Would definitely recommend this place. 

The only (minor) issues were that the bar stools were too high for the counter, making it awkward for sitting at. Also, part of the rug is curled up and should be taped down as it was a tripping hazard. Still an overall great place."
8116523,87218286,2016-07-19,79051311,Andre,Perfect location!  A few blocks from Boston Public Garden and Boston Common.  Very close to Charles River and Newbury Street as well.  I walked everywhere!  The apartment was clean and in a nice neighborhood.  Frank was an amazing host.  He's very responsive and answered all my questions in a timely manner.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in the Back Bay area.
8116523,87686783,2016-07-21,55441835,Matt,Very welcome and very communicative and helpful. Thank you Frank.

The place was was picturesque and felt like home. Back Bay was lovely. Would like to come back and enjoy the fall color. My host answered all my questions and was knowledgable of the neighborhood. This was my first time using Airbnb. The bar was set pretty high. I truly recommend this home if you'd like the quintessential Boston experience.

8116523,97350429,2016-08-27,16718987,Chris,"Frank's airbnb rental was as described.  It is a great location, very clean.  Frank is meticulous about communication prior to arrival.  I had no problems during my stay, and actually found the bed one of the most comfortable beds I've experienced in an Airbnb place.  Only downside is that noise from neighboring apartments can be heard (ie footsteps, sound of showers, etc...)"

8116523,101660582,2016-09-14,25441073,Heather,"Frank's place was in a lovely area and easy to get around. The unit was tidy and had everything we needed. Our only problem was that it was a ground floor unit and located under/beside the stairs and you could hear other occupants coming and going. The listing stated it was a guiet unit and we needed to keep the noise down, maybe that should be passed on to the neighbours upstairs ? "
8116523,104858353,2016-09-29,6197536,Alejandra,"This place is in a great location.  We were able to walk everywhere!  There are parks close by and great restaurants and shops just a couple of blocks away.  
Frank was very quick to respond to messages and check in and out went very smoothly.  
The only downside is that you can hear noise from neighbors.  But other than that it is a great place for a short stay in Boston!"

8116523,108836933,2016-10-17,985476,Dana,"Excellent arrival instructions, clean place, very handy home guidebook, easy check out. Frank has it down to a science. We loved having a place to stay so close to Boston Common, Back Bay, and Beacon Hill. The kitchen appliances we a huge plus!

Just to echo what others have said, you will hear some street noise and footsteps from upstairs.

Highly recommend Da Vinci if you're in town for a special occasion. We also loved the Lessons on Liberty tour led by local historians.

8116523,112905864,2016-11-08,50308513,Patrick,"Great location in one of the best neighborhoods in the city.  The bed in the bedroom is amazingly comfortable.  They do have a listing that they provide an optional second bed available.  This is not technically correct as the second bed is a blow-up mattress.  However, all and all the stay was great.  

A note on great service: I errantly left the keys inside the condo and didn't get off work until super late (after midnight) and the host was able to quickly help us out.  He came over and was able to let us in.  Big relief...and was super helpful.  "
8116523,113010453,2016-11-09,93430103,Wayne,Great location!

8116523,114081762,2016-11-15,22285195,Lydia,"Just got back from staying at Frank's apartment, and it was perfect for my needs, just a 20minute walk from the Hynes convention center and 20 minutes from the boston public library, public gardens, newbury street. Also has a great little playground just around the corner. The apartment was very comfortable, quiet. No washer dryer, but our stay was short enough for that to not be a issue. Definitely recommend!"
8116523,114587355,2016-11-19,7201454,Janka,"I adored staying at Frank's place. Located in the high-end residential neighborhood of Back Bay, it was a quick walk to the nearest T stop (Copley) and to the shops and restaurants of Newbury Street. The Boston Public Library is nearby and definitely worth a visit. I had a fantastic seafood dinner at the Saltie Girl restaurant just down the road on Dartmouth St. And for a nightcap, the Cheers bar is only a couple of blocks away from the apartment!

The apartment itself was lovely - clean and cosy and very quiet. It had everything I needed for a 4-night business trip, and Frank was even kind enough to make sure that I had an iron and ironing board to use during my stay. Frank was also a perfect host - making sure I had directions and that I checked in safely, providing recommendations for the local area, but otherwise just leaving me to it to enjoy my stay.

This was my first trip to Boston, and I can't wait to visit again - I'll definitely be staying at Frank's!"
8116523,120327248,2016-12-09,105068162,Shay,Frank place is near all the shops and everything is walking distance. If you don't want to walk then an uber ride to all the stores were no more than $5.00 bucks. Franks home was very spacious and clean. He even offers Netflix for free. This place was awesome.

We are early to bed folk, and the neighbors who shared our bedroom wall were relatively loud until late, but that is to be expected on a weekend, and did not diminish our enjoyment of the place. 
overall, great stay!! "
8116523,128793653,2017-01-27,20684670,Jeff,"Great place! Really felt at home but right in the center. Near Backbay, Newbury and the Commons. Quiet and cozy. High speed wifi too!"

Apartment was clean and cozy. within walking distance to shopping and restaurants, perfect location to explore the Back Bay Area of Boston. would definitely stay here again! Our only recommendation would be to provide an easier way to watch TV or stronger wifi. The connection was not always good, we noticed with our phones too. Thanks!"
8116523,131082365,2017-02-10,109458220,Sarah,"Excellent communication with frank; quick to respond
The apartment is amazingly cute. Just as it is pictured. The bedroom can get a little hot overnight. We left a door slightly open.

8116523,133599899,2017-02-23,21656477,Tristan,"The place itself was a bit small, but everything worked and looked great.  The fact that it's got easy access to South Station (and thus Logan too) is a real boon."

8116523,137124410,2017-03-13,9271450,Jessica,This location is great for exploring Boston on foot. Fun neighborhood and close to great attractions. Public transportation is also close so you can easily get to other parts of the city. Really enjoyed our stay here.
8116523,137976487,2017-03-18,58359986,Bennett,"Great location! Frank communicated with me often. Noise from the above apartments was noticeable but not a bother. The memory foam mattress reminded me of home, and I slept well each night.  It was about a 15 minute walk to the Hynes convention center. I would stay here again. "
8116523,138379500,2017-03-19,40079413,John,"Very well located apartment, comfortable and clean. Frank is responsive and attentive. Certainly an enjoyable place to stay. "
8116523,139097022,2017-03-23,99107633,Erin,"Frank's place was easily accessible and an ideal location for getting to know Boston. He is central to Boston Common, Freedom Trail, Newbury Street and Fenway Park. As parking is difficult to find in Boston, it is easy to get around by foot. We loved staying at Frank's and would recommend his home to a couple or small family of 3. "
8116523,139750553,2017-03-26,36465767,Drew,This garden-level apartment worked great for my girlfriend and I to explore the city from - walking to Copley square for shopping and transportation was a breeze
8116523,140543535,2017-03-30,20201592,Belen,"The flat was just like the pics, really clean and close to all the touristic places, perfect location! :)
Frank was a great host and was really quick replying my emails.
Would love to stay here again next time I'm in Boston. Thank you Frank!"
8116523,141556578,2017-04-03,694157,Scott,"Great little place in a great spot. 
As advertised and recommended. "
8116523,143379200,2017-04-11,54765381,Cj,"WHO KNEW THE BEST COULD BE HAD SO INEXPENSIVELY!

This was my first time to Boston, so I had no idea I was planning a couple's get away in the heart of the city's most prime real estate. Beacon Hills is most beautiful. Plus, the wife was impressed with my choice - so extra kudos. 

A quick walk in either direction takes you to convenient food, shopping and tourist attractions including The Freedom Trail, Boston Common and the famed Cheers pub (yes THAT Cheers pub). If in town for the Marathon, the finish line is also in 'tired legs' walking distance. BTW the public library just around the corner is a can't miss site seeing locale. HOW IS THAT?

Frank's place was clean and cozy, and I would definitely consider booking again on my next trip to one of my new favorite stateside destinations. 

Still no Pats fan though - BOO!"
8116523,145876791,2017-04-20,48779254,Julia,"Frank's place is really amazing! You get to have the experience of staying in a traditional New England building but all the convenience and comfort necessary. Very well located, it makes really easy to go around and explore the town. Also, Frank was always very helpful and answer promptly when we needed informations. I would definitely go back and recommend his apartment"
8116523,146774924,2017-04-23,302373,Lisa,"Frank's apartment is centrally located, clean, convenient, easy check in. Frank is also very easy to comunicare with."
8116523,147551478,2017-04-27,5617936,Arianna,"Esperienza pessima! Appartamento senza chiave e con chiusura automatizzata. A causa della pioggia ( così come detto dal property manager) la porta non si è chiusa la seconda notte con il risultato che abbiamo passato la notte a fare la guardia. 
Abbiamo contattato subito l'host ma ci ha risposto la mattina dopo. Gli abbiamo chiesto di posticipare di un paio d'ore il check out per recuperare un po' di riposo e ha risposto no. Abbiamo quindi chiesto se potevamo lasciare le valigie fino alle 14 ( il nuovo Check in sarebbe stato alle 15) ma ci ha negato anche questo. 
Rigidità e inefficienza. Non consiglio a nessuno questo appartamento. "
8116523,149067114,2017-05-02,115335312,Lisa,The location was the best --- quiet neighborhood but Beacon Street does have traffic.  Very homey and comfortable.  Would definitely stay here again... heck I would live here!!!  BEAUTIFUL area/city.
8116523,151408784,2017-05-12,126683495,Noura,"Frank was great host, quick response to my emails, the shower had shampoos and conditioners just like home with good quality products. Location was good as well."
8116523,153642537,2017-05-21,90292436,Debbie,"We enjoyed our stay.  Frank's place is clean and comfortable. It is within walking distance to the markets, restaurants and the train station. "
8116523,154246698,2017-05-23,129437111,Rohan,Lovely place to stay and a great location 
8116523,157110178,2017-06-02,476464,Shana,Beautiful and clean. Great location! 
8116523,159076224,2017-06-09,13000199,Mark,"Franks apartment is in a great situation in Back Bay close to shops and restaurants and Boston Common. 

Easy walking distance to all sights. 

Communication always quick and helpful."
8116523,160541139,2017-06-14,64255796,Anand,"Amazingly central and walkable to Newbury Street/the convention center/etc. 
The place was clean and had an overabundance of linens and towels!

I highly recommend it!"
8116523,162124917,2017-06-19,13406519,Eszter And Aubrey,"A nice little apartment with a great location. We had some problems with the TV and some other questions, but Frank replied every message in just a few minutes and he was very helpful.
"
8116523,163146369,2017-06-23,113594538,Nicole,"Frank's apartment is even nicer than the photos suggest, and the neighborhood is fantastic. Frank was very quick about responding to messages and even provided me with a lot of information before I decided to book the apartment. I had an incredible stay in Boston, and this apartment (and Frank!) was a large part of what made it so great. "
8116523,172070439,2017-07-19,19400745,Carrie,"Great location for access to Back Bay, Beacon Hill and the Esplanade. Only downside is that the bedroom doesn't have windows, so it got a little stuffy at night."
8116523,176223220,2017-07-30,6705551,Anna,Amazing location
8116523,180162506,2017-08-09,3433996,Cris,Fantastic location on one of the best streets in Boston. Having a private entrance was a huge plus.
8116523,185044439,2017-08-20,93569431,Jerry,"AMAZING spot. Perfect location, beautiful inside, cozy, clean, and classy. Do it"
8116523,189427069,2017-09-01,33482893,Loc,"Frank is nice and quickly reply. The place is close to the central, it took 8min walk to the green line train station that would lead you everywhere. The property is abit old ( it is brown brick)."
8116523,189739750,2017-09-02,107409326,Logan,"Frank's place is great.  Wonderful location that is convenient to good restaurants, shopping, and bars.  Would definitely stay there again next time I visit Boston!"
8116523,190521751,2017-09-04,93924806,Leah,awesome location and easy check-in and out. Perfect spot for a mother-daughter trip to the city!
8116523,191479775,2017-09-07,90772860,Kerry,"Frank's place is very conveniently located.  The apartment is pretty much as described in the listing and other reviews.  The only thing that made my stay less than great was that the walls are somewhat thin so at times you can hear the neighbors.  This was mainly a problem when I could hear the neighbor at 4am on a Wednesday singing a mix of 90s and early 2000s hip-hop and pop music, but that may have been an anomaly."
8116523,191676187,2017-09-08,41052351,Siobhan,We were really looking forward to our stay at Frank's place as it is in a great location. The apartment was nice however we were unable to stay and subsequently cancelled our reservation because the front door which opened onto the street could not be secured either from the inside or the outside. When I contacted the host he said it locked just fine and was unwilling to discuss the issue by phone. He did eventually send someone by to try to fix the door but they were unsuccessful. We booked into a hotel but ending up losing our first of two nights in Boston because of this issue. Thankfully Airbnb refunded us without delay.
8116523,192511933,2017-09-10,15088420,Steve,"Perfect location and close to the ""T"" stations (Copley, Arlington). Would definitely consider staying here again the next time we're in Boston.  The host was great at communicating and keeping in touch."
8116523,193197541,2017-09-12,81204263,Zhan,"Frank's apartment is exactly as described, clean, quiet and in the most desirable location in Boston.  The one bedroom apartment is perfect for two and can accommodate up to four.  Frank sent over the checkin information timely and always responded quickly to my questions.  We totally enjoyed our stay there."
8116523,194350559,2017-09-16,142677558,Janette,"This is a beautiful apartment in a beautiful building on one of the most beautiful streets in the Back Bay.  Apartment small but exquisitely designed, with exposed brick walls, wide-plank wooden floors.  Just a few blocks from the Esplanade along the Charles River which is ideal for morning jogs and evening walks.  Perfect location in multiple ways: 2 blocks from Boston Common and Public Garden; short walk to the State House on Beacon Hill and in my opinion it's one of the most beautiful state houses in the country with its golden dome.  about 7 mins walk to the Green Line stop of Arlington, which means you can get to Museum of Fine Arts, Isabella Gardner Museum, Symphony Hall, the splendid newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, now gathering the 3 earlier collections into one stunning space.  And of course there are fabulous restaurants and bistros a short walking distance away.  Do spend lots of time browsing Newbury Street and Harvard Square."
8116523,196294497,2017-09-22,70526508,Mary,"We loved our stay in this pretty, little apartment. We walked to everything. Our host gave us great ideas of where to visit and eat. Wish we had a few more days."
8116523,197726075,2017-09-26,111849100,Harrison,"This Airbnb is in the heart of beacon and perfect location to get to places. Kind of small, but perfect for 2 people - maybe a third on the air mattress. You are going to spend most of your time in the city, this place has all the necessities to come back and get some sleep."
8116523,199681603,2017-10-02,142618674,Ruth,"Frank was very responsive and ensured we had all the information we needed in order to access this property seamlessly. Where it is located is central to shopping, parks, the Charles river and historical sites. If you love to run and plan to do so on your trip, as I did, this is a great location to stay. Plenty to do in this area and everything seemed to be a walk or an inexpensive Uber ride away. Thank you for your hospitality Frank, and thank you for making my first bnb experience a positive one."
