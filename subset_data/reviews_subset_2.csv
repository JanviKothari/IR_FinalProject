14406532,124783676,2017-01-02,56609651,Dee,Spacious and comfortable! Close to great restaurants and sights. Ronda was a wonderful host and had great suggestions for places to go see and eat.
14406532,125223408,2017-01-04,22380519,Marci,"My Airbnb experience was fantastic.  Our host name is Ronda and she is so warm and welcoming. We really enjoyed spending time with her.  She provided several beverages and snacks as well as dog treats. There is a mini fridge, a microwave & a coffee maker.  It really felt like home.  She also provided us recommendations of places to see and things to do in the area.  I was thankful for everything she did.  It had everything you could possible need.  I loved having a private entrance into the suite. It was a great neighborhood and convenient to everything. I will recommend this Airbnb to everyone I know.  Thank you Ronda!"
14406532,130330423,2017-02-05,45158105,Meghan,Ronda was a wonderful hostess!!! She was incredibly friendly and communicative! Her place was cozy and beautiful! Ronda supplied us with everything we could have needed and a wonderful experience 
14406532,136097770,2017-03-08,7917113,Michael,Ronda is a fantastic host who is very responsive. I highly recommend the stay. 
14406532,137117801,2017-03-13,27476375,Pete,"Very comfortable place to stay. Ronda is a very friendly, helpful host. We will definitely be returning."
14406532,138397701,2017-03-19,14719992,Yoni,"Ronda is a very warm host. We enjoyed meeting her and appreciated the extra care for our dogs staying with us.
The space was great!
If we travel to Boston again, we will reach out to Ronda."
14406532,138597670,2017-03-20,19578580,Jenna,Ronda is warm and welcoming. She had a note for my dog and one for me on how to make the most of our stay. A great fenced in backyard and private off the main street. 
14406532,139114553,2017-03-23,95913771,Amanda,"As a frequent traveler for both business & fun, I love to have a variety of travel options. Since staying in hotels can get boring, airbnb allows me to feel like I'm home, while away from home. I really enjoyed the private entrance, the directions and parking info were very clear, and I really appreciated being able to bring my kitten on this overnight trip. The bedroom is quiet and comfortable, the living room has a large desk if you need to work, and the wifi was fast! The kitchen-area has both a large microwave and small fridge which is great when you live on shakes and take out salads like me. The snacks, coffee, creamer, water, etc. were a welcome treat as well. If you have trouble with stairs (I don't!) then keep in mind that this is a lower level entrance so you will need to walk up/down stairs to enter/exit. There was plenty of room in the bathroom, even a washer/dryer (which I never need when I travel, but is a nice addition!). "
14406532,139828606,2017-03-26,120830546,Michael,excellent!!
14406532,141321101,2017-04-02,72349171,Molly,Great little place. Very clean and cute and comfortable!!
14406532,142828076,2017-04-09,5721712,Mora,"Ronda's apartment was a perfect place for a dog-friendly trip to Boston. She obviously puts a lot of care into the details of your stay, from goodies for both you and your furry companions, to the attentive and communicative check-in. She was even kind enough to anticipate we would need a late check-out after we told her our plans for our final day and coordinated it with the people staying after us. The location is also a perfect balance between easy access to all the typical Boston things you would want, as well as a little more calm from the hustle and bustle of the downtown. We enjoyed a number of walks through the nearby green spaces which made for a very pleasant, sunny spring weekend in the city. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to bring their dog to the city."
14406532,142979080,2017-04-09,16163213,Eleni,The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14406532,143578729,2017-04-12,29582698,Michelle,Everything was great. The extra snacks for me and the treats for the dog was a great touch. Ronda was great at communicating with check in and out. Definitly a great stay. 
14406532,144390197,2017-04-15,39952629,Melissa,"Rhonda and the apartment were great! We brought our pup with us and he loved running around the yard in the mornings. It was an ideal spot for us for brewery hopping and hiking in Canton. Would be happy to stay again, especially once it gets warmer and more restaurants put out outdoor dining tables! ☺️"
14406532,145267225,2017-04-17,102241727,Cristin,"We traveled to Boston for the Marathon and wanted to stay somewhere outside of downtown. Ronda's place was great! It's a really cute basement apartment that is fully stocked with snacks, toiletries, etc. The area has beautiful homes, a really neat park, and some great restaurants! Driving to downtown Boston was really easy. I highly recommend Ronda's place, and I will definitely try to stay there again in the future!"
14406532,146613607,2017-04-23,76152568,Annette,"The photos do not do it justice. It is very private. Nice space for two people. Large bathroom and clean shower with two shower heads. Washer and dryer. Snacks and water which got me through my first night. I was too tired to even order out. Rhonda is an absolute sweetheart. Warm welcome. Not intrusive. Would barely know she was there but she magically appears when you do. Her place is very dog friendly. Sheets for on the furniture. I asked for something to mop the floor with because it was raining and we were both leaving footprints on the entryway. She said ""No worries.""  There is a great cemetery across the way. You would think it would be creepy. Beautiful and great place to walk. I can't say enough. Thanks again. We would love to stay again in the future.   "
14406532,148020072,2017-04-29,121030085,Macey,I really enjoyed my stay. The private studio was very very nice. Ronda was so sweet and left us snacks to munch on while we were there. The only thing I would change is that the water in the shower would stay hot a little longer. We were left no information of what to do when we checked out except to place the key under the mat. We felt bad about not cleaning or taking trash out & such. So we took our trash to the nearest bin when we left. We did really love our stay here & would most definitely stay again. 
14406532,151977510,2017-05-14,48621297,Caroline,"Rhonda was a great host.  She was great enough to call me with details on where to park and was so sweet even after we had some confusion and called her for a 3rd time in one night for directions lol.  The suite was perfect for our visit-clean and simple.  Nice little set up with some coffee, tea and a little bowl of snacks was a great touch! "
14406532,153940229,2017-05-22,24796845,Sandra,"Our stay in Boston was made very comfortable because of Ronda's place. She is a great host, and thought of all the things we might need while we were there: towels, snacks, coffee machine, washing machine, television. She also allowed us an immense amount of privacy and independence, which my husband and I appreciated. She communicated very well and her home is in a gorgeous setting in Boston. It's not terribly close to public transportation, but it seems as though most people Uber nowadays anyway (my husband and I took a train, a bus, and walked to get there the first day, then got rides from our family members the other days). We got the whole apartment, which is in the basement, to ourselves (it has a separate entrance). We were very comfortable there, apart from the quirks one often encounters while spending time in a basement - things like hearing loud footsteps, pet dog(s) sprinting and barking, and other noises from the house above. I would recommend this listing if you're not phased by those things!"
14406532,154451841,2017-05-24,60538911,Katarah,"Ronda's place is beautiful, the yard was great for our dog and the neighborhood walkable. She was attentive and great to deal with! Wonderful hospitality! "
14406532,156696093,2017-05-31,41255605,Brian,Rhonda's place was very clean and quiet. Rhonda checked on us periodically from time to time to make sure everything was good to go. Definitely would recommend het place to anyone and would use her place again in the future. 
14406532,158036703,2017-06-05,113338008,Tineke En Piet,"Prima studio. Schoon, rustig. Met allerlei lekkernijen. Geen keuken en inventaris."

14406532,159719563,2017-06-11,117833595,Stephanie,"Stayed here for a Night and it was very comfy, next time I visit West Roxbury I will definitely stay here. Ronda made it very comfy as if it was your own little Apartment. She even left us Muffins for Breakfast. Recommend this to any one looking for a private Apartment for a short stay. Better than any hotel , hands down. "
14406532,163107028,2017-06-23,70824498,Nicolas,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ronda's place, everything was great. It is a little far from downtown, but it is still easy to get there using public transportation. Really calm neighborhood. "
14406532,164211150,2017-06-26,24519648,Nathalie,Perfect location and very quiet. We loved the neighborhood.  Very toughfull host. Thanks for all the little attention. 
14406532,164756316,2017-06-29,95885654,Henry,Ronda provides a convenient and comfortable place if you need to be based in the Boston area. Good amenities and close to any number of Boston neighborhoods. 
14406532,165028653,2017-06-30,74058719,Gwen,Ronda has a lovely place to stay. Very comfortable and welcoming. The snacks were a great treat. The bed is very comfortable.
14406532,165365872,2017-07-01,136770878,Angela,"We really enjoyed staying with Ronda. My husband and I stayed just for a night with our cat, and it was a very quiet, private, and lovely stay. She provided some snacks, drinks, and clear house rules, and was very easy to communicate with. Everything was clean and the space was simple but comfortable.

I would recommend going out to eat (as opposed to ordering delivery) because you may have to wait outside to get your food since many delivery drivers have issues finding the place! We were able to get some pizza there, but we had to stand outside! Not a huge thing, but just something to be aware of!"
14406532,166172926,2017-07-02,127738829,Barry,"Very nice almost apartment (sitting room, tight bedroom, toilet and shower, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker). Location in comfortable, private-home area of far west of Boston (West Roxbury) is great if you have family in the neighborhood or a car, but not convenient for the T. We enjoyed our stay. "
14406532,168514804,2017-07-09,42164388,Valeria,Thanks everything was great !!! 
14406532,169493965,2017-07-12,27476375,Pete,"Ronda is a wonderful host. In addition to enjoying the accommodations, we always look forward to seeing her and having the chance to chat!"
14406532,170972729,2017-07-16,42059899,Hector,"Just wow! I arrived a few minutes before my check in time right then Ronda was pulling in too. She welcomed me as if she was one of my relatives that I hadn’t seen in a long time. Loved the conversation and the story telling so engaging and sincere, she then suggested a few places to visit and a place to run which I did. Just and excellent host!! But I’m sure if you stay with her you too will feel the same way. Thank you Ronda for the great accommodations until next time. "
14406532,171768827,2017-07-18,129570487,François,Thank you Ronda everything was perfect.
14406532,172025267,2017-07-19,50750435,Conor,This is a perfect little space just down the street (10.00 Uber ride) to Boston. It is great for a much cheaper alternative to the ridiculously priced Boston hotels for quick business travel. Ronda was helpful and a good host. The wireless signal was strong and it was easy to get work done in the downtime.
14406532,172914833,2017-07-22,66390150,Nolan,"Ronda's place was great! Her response to our messages and emails was almost immediate, she was extremely helpful in all aspects and the little things such as cold water bottles ready and a few snacks left out for us made our stay even better! I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the Boston area!"
14406532,176223793,2017-07-30,62167310,Giancarlo,Incredible place to stay. Very accommodating host
14406532,177725875,2017-08-03,126934830,Marie,"Schöne kleine Unterkunft in einer Art Vorort von Boston. Man braucht sicher eine Stunde um in die Innenstadt zu kommen und nach 20 Uhr gibt es keine gute Verbindung mehr. Dann heißt es 20-25 Minuten Fußweg.
Die Unterkunft ist ausreichend groß und bietet das nötigste: ordentliches Bett und Bad (mit Waschmaschine und Trockner), Mikrowelle und einen kleinen Kühlschrank. TV und Internet funktionieren auch problemlos.
Man sollte sich nicht an Tierhaaren stören, die hier und da sichtbar sind, da diese auch in die Unterkunft mitgebracht werden können. 
Ronda war wirklich hilfsbereit und nett (sie hat mir geholfen einen super Geburtstagskuchen zu organisieren). Sie stellt sogar kleine Snacks und leckere Muffins bereit :)"
14406532,179009212,2017-08-06,124152933,Linda,"She leaves plenty of snacks. 
Lots of privacy.  
Great walking area in the cemetery nearby."
14406532,181383781,2017-08-12,6595410,F,Ronda's place is perfect for our stays for work and pleasure in Boston. She is very accommodating and welcoming to my furry friends too! A great place to stay and enjoy the city and more!
14406532,183206698,2017-08-16,123909808,Dennis,Great spot south boston in 20 min by car. Spent most our time in city we just used this spot for sleeping. Ronda was always there when we had a question or just to say hi..thanks for taking us in..dennis and mary
14406532,184915647,2017-08-20,23578410,Shelly,It's an ok place to stay. A bit far from downtown. We spent around $60 a day on uber rides into Boston.
14406532,187789875,2017-08-27,107076935,Debi,"Ronda is an amazing hostess - not only did she provide munchies, bottled water and coffee & cream - but she had some dog treats ready and waiting for my 4-legged companion!  The fenced yard was perfect for early morning and late night potty breaks for my dog - and the cemetery and neighborhood were great for longer walks.  The location was awesome, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was larger than expected."
14406532,189729842,2017-09-02,50820652,Iashai,Great scenic area that is very quiet.  Ronda's place is also nice and cozy! You will love it.
14406532,190144293,2017-09-03,16072739,Kate,"Ronda's place was spacious, comfortable, and clean. Ronda seemed to have anticipated her guest's needs and went great length to prepare accordingly. We would definitely recommend Ronda's place to everyone."
14406532,192043718,2017-09-09,102921765,Ryan,"Ronda was extremely friendly and helpful when I was having issues with one of my dogs. She had everything you could need as a visitor: towels, snacks, blankets, washer and dryer to use, even bags to pick up after my dog. She was available if I needed her, but respected my privacy which was a nice balance. Overall I would absolutely stay here again."
14406532,192575496,2017-09-10,120808320,Steve,"It was really quite well laid out little place perfect for a couple. Close to everything, we had a lot of fun!"
14406532,193185574,2017-09-12,148273047,Daniela,"This was our first road trip as a little family of two adults and two little furpups and Ronda made it amazing. Our pups enjoyed the stayed and Ronda was thoughtful enough to leave out treats, bowls and poop bags for them. The space was clean and very tidy. Ronda also left us snacks that we definitely enjoyed. We couldn't have asked for more in our stay and will definitely be coming back!"
14406532,194333614,2017-09-16,103883287,James,"Ronda's unit was as described and was a great place to stay.  She left out some nice drinks and snacks as well, which were welcome after a long drive!  It was nice and quiet too for when we went to sleep.  I would highly recommend to anyone staying in or around Boston.  Easy and quick rides to downtown Boston in lyft and uber as well"
14406532,194855872,2017-09-17,49964975,Lita,rondas place was as mentioned. perfect spot for small couple and quiet animal. not far from boston and reasonable price

He welcomed me at 2am in the morning with a smile on his face and while we didn't have much time to talk, I sensed a great energy from him.  His room was perfect for what I needed that night. 

Thanks again!"
12308927,86007929,2016-07-14,5764289,Enri,"Hola la habitación de Héctor fue perfecta para mi día de paso por Boston y Héctor fue muy amable, solo puedo recomendarlo, el metro esta a solo 4 minutos a pie y 10 minutos con metro y bus del aeropuerto, muchas gracias y saludos"
12308927,86204027,2016-07-15,32294620,Armin,"I needed a place to stay after arriving in Boston before going on to Provincetown. Hectors place is perfectly located close to the airport, still quiet neighborhood. Boston center is away 7min by tube. The walk to the station is 3min. Perfect stay, Hector was very caring. All very uncomplicated. "
12308927,86427645,2016-07-16,22726866,Mark,"I had a nice stay at Hector's place.

Overall it was exactly what I expected and what I was looking for: a place close to the airport (walking distance to Maverick and Airport stations), a room to sleep at between flights. Unfortunately, Hector was not there, but he was very responsive via messages through AirBnB app. Overall, was a very smooth experience."
12308927,102887192,2016-09-19,49846542,Annalaura,"Hector is very nice and helpful- for directions restaurants, everything. very easy to communicate with him. The place is close to airport so it s ok if you need a bed to spend the night before taking off. I had the AC in the room that was very loud  so although the bed wasnt bad, i had a hard time to sleep. The place is overall clean, But I think a change of air every once in a while will be good- the smell wasn t great. "
12308927,103259231,2016-09-21,20723945,George,"I only needed a place to stay in Boston for an overnight layover coming home from Europe.  Hector's Airbnb was perfect for me.  It is close to the airport; there is a great Italian/pizza restaurant just down the street; and the room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a good hot shower.  The next morning I was able to walk from Hector's to Logan -- a 30 minute walk. 
Hector was not at home when I arrived, but he left excellent instructions for getting into the Airbnb."
12308927,103266448,2016-09-21,64672518,Yi,Hectors place is really clean and convenient!  I would definitely stay there again.   
12308927,103530240,2016-09-23,78357583,Sandra,"Very nice, clean and cosy place. Directly nearby the blue line trainstation."
12308927,103625061,2016-09-23,39252042,Herbert,Very convenient location! Hector was very responsive to my questions and his instructions were clear. Highly recommended!
12308927,103876144,2016-09-24,35522254,Freda,I am very sorry that I did not get to stay in this cute bedroom.  My flight was changed and I did not spend the night in Boston.  I will say that Hector always responded to me anytime I had a question and he had an excellent U-tube showing the apartment.  I could not ask for better communication before the stay and I loved the fact that the apartment was so close to the airport.  That is why I was not able to rate all of the questions on the survey.  I would definitely stay in Hector's apartment again.
12308927,104151413,2016-09-25,27162348,Eugenia,"Totally recommended! I stayed in Hector's house just for one night. Everything was great! The house is just 3 blocks away from the metro station, a perfect location. Hector is an amazing host! If I return to Boston I will definetly go back to Hector's house."
12308927,104440847,2016-09-26,29664195,Eric,"Convenient, simple little airbnb near the airport and blue line. Hector sent all the information a few days prior to check-in, which was easy & streamlined."
12308927,104621816,2016-09-27,7720907,Kostiantyn,"good location - very close to city center and airport (one stop to every side), good park is near with superb views to city and sunset.

very-very comfortable bed - don't want to leave it in the morning :)"
12308927,104851107,2016-09-28,14340856,Kevin,"I was only in town VERY briefly on a layover but Hector's place was perfect for what I needed.  A clean room, comfortable bed and Hector has the system down to a science as far as accessing the place.  The apartment is a short walk to the T station that accesses the airport (or you could Uber.)    

I'd definitely recommend for travelers with overnight layovers at Logan.  "
12308927,104948037,2016-09-29,30589635,Geeta,"Hector was very helpful, communicative and friendly.  The place was exactly what i needed - a room to put my head down near the blue line and airport - so very convenient! "
12308927,105155476,2016-09-30,6067810,Danielle,"Hector saved the day! 
I missed my connection in Boston and was rebooked on a flight early the following morning. I immediately went on Airbnb to find a place to sleep for the night and Hector replied to me in seconds. I took an uber to his place, he was there to meet me at the door, and helped me with my suitcase up the stairs. I took a shower and went to sleep. I departed early in the am with an uber taxi back to the airport. The 2 uber rides and his home cost me under $99. 
I could have never found a better value at any hotel ( I looked ) 
Hector was welcoming, friendly, and responded immediately to my booking request. 
It's amazing how a missed connection worked out so great. 
Thank you Hector, Airbnb, and uber for changing the way we travel ! 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HECTORS HOME! The home was clean and simple! Thank you Hector for all you help! "
12308927,106171711,2016-10-04,71967756,Kasa,Great place to stay! Very close to the train stations (as advertised) and Hector provided me with clear instructions on how to obtain the key since he was not at home when I arrived. Nice little spot with everything you need for a stay :) Thank you! 
12308927,106322163,2016-10-05,35588702,Winifred,"Hector was very communicative. He made sure I knew exactly how to get keys, open doors, lock doors and directions to his place. I was flying out of Logan early and it was the perfect location to the get to airport. Clean and comfortable. I met Hector briefly and he was very nice. I would recommend his place and would also stay here again if i need. Thank you."
12308927,106497437,2016-10-06,89708951,Nikola,"Above my every expetations, Hector is a great guy. I slept one night over there and if i come to Boston again i would like to be at this apartment again."
12308927,106670343,2016-10-07,31309730,Maryli,Experience was great - clear communication ahead of time that made the check-in process very easy. Apartment description was accurate - close to the airport and is a cozy space.

12308927,109128921,2016-10-19,78543055,Tatiana,"Hector is very polite, accomodating, and a great host! His place is really nice and very close to the train station. Definitely recommend you to book his place if you're visiting Boston."
12308927,109273622,2016-10-20,95148596,Uday,"Hector's place is VERY CONVENIENT, close to Logan airport (I actually walked from Blue Line Airport terminus) and also near Blue Line subway station. Hector was excellent with his communication all along although he was not present when I reached his place. He provided good tips for my Boston day-trip also. Room/bathroom was very clean, bottled drinking water was also provided. Room has a/c which also helped. It is a quiet place as well.

Overall, I liked the stay at Hector's place and will certainly recommend it to friends & stay there again."
12308927,109620016,2016-10-22,95126609,Madelynn,Awesome host. Answered all questions I had very quickly and was super nice. I recommend if you're coming to Boston. =)
12308927,109914221,2016-10-23,74158759,Becky,"If you need a quick stay near the airport and the blue line, Hector has the perfect little room for you.  Easy to find, the North End is a short train stop away, place is clean and comfy.  "
12308927,110163241,2016-10-24,26749562,Alessia,"I just wanted a place to rest before my flight back in Italy after a very long day and week and it worked just fine. The place is quiet even if i found the keys method tricky, but we use different ways in Europe and i was almost falling asleep on my knees when i arrived. "
12308927,110473528,2016-10-26,44527593,Joachim,"All worked out very well. Check-in was well organised, location is very convenient to reach from the airport and metro system, place was clean, and Hector is a very nice man and a welcoming host. All good,  recommended! "
12308927,110637019,2016-10-27,61640841,Satoko,"Hector was a really nice host, responsive and clear communicator. "
12308927,111516562,2016-10-31,5150659,Nuala,Hector made everything very simple to follow everything was as he explained and the location was spot on.
12308927,111905928,2016-11-02,46313574,Jessa,"Communication: Hector is good with trying to clarify arrangements prior your stay. Instructions: The entry door-lock is simple thanks to the videoclip...then up the stairs and into the first door you encounter; both guestrooms are beside eachother to the left, upon entering. Amneties: It was simple so it was comfortable with basic areas for your day (the limit is only 1 night stay per person so I didn't get around to using the household appliances/common areas since I arrived nighttime, but they had made a Welcome binder of where these house items are located & local brochures they picked up for activity recommendations). Location: If arriving with a car, it is harder to find parking once residents return home, so be sure to ask for permit or suggestions of where to park. Be sure not to let (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)maps/gps try to autocorrect Sumner to Summer. It was generally a peaceful neighborhood; around 4:30am, there was intermittent, creaky drops for more than 5mins at the corner head of the bed, but I was able to return to sleep just fine. It had been raining the previous nights so maybe some light drizzle was draining? Other than that, it's a nice resting place if you need something quick & easy before returning to the airport."
12308927,112035055,2016-11-03,21039214,Richard,All good. Instructions were clear and it was great for the airport. 
12308927,112175958,2016-11-04,99926908,Nick,"Hector is a really nice guy, if you're travelling to and from Logan airport it's such a great location. Take the T, its a 5min walk."

12308927,112758992,2016-11-07,53751682,Kathryn,"Hectors place is exactly as described, very cozy and it's great if you need a spot by the airport. The aquarium, which is pretty central in the city, is one subway stop away so really nothing is too far. Hector is a wonderful host, very friendly and extremely helpful if you have any questions. I would definitely recommend staying with Hector."
12308927,114031788,2016-11-15,87484989,Carlyn,"Hector is a great host! He sent detailed instructions for getting into the apartment before my arrival. He answered any questions I had right away. The space is clean and comfortable. It is a short walk to the T, and one stop from the airport. It's a great accommodation for anyone who is looking for something convenient to downtown Boston. I would highly recommend staying with Hector!"
12308927,114206178,2016-11-16,96585447,Vincent,Within walking distance to the airport. Great running opportunity along the harbor and greenway. 
12308927,114315965,2016-11-17,94704507,Luree,"Hector's place was very cozy. It was a very clean and inviting place. It is a two minute walk from the beautiful Piers Park with gorgeous scenic views of downtown. It is also a short walk from the subway and bus, so if you are coming from the airport I highly recommend the subway as it is only a couple dollars and only one stop away to Maverick Square. "
12308927,114448646,2016-11-18,7927094,Vincent,This was my second time staying at Hector's and it was just as convenient and pleasant as the first time around!
12308927,114598484,2016-11-19,100966761,Haoyu,A excellent place.
12308927,114866944,2016-11-20,29995324,Linda,Super convenient place to stay near the airport with easy check in. Last night was the third time that I've stayed at Hector's- that kind of says a lot.
12308927,115055287,2016-11-21,102423629,Uka,"The place is cozy and clean. Host is very friendly and nice. Location is great, metro station is in 2-3 min walk distance. I'll definitely stay here again when I visit Boston."
12308927,115189189,2016-11-22,76442251,Lisa,Hector was very nice and helpful for my stay. The room was clean and comfortable was a bit noisy but that's just normal city living. 
12308927,115537454,2016-11-25,5146183,Lexie,"I was looking for a quiet, clean place to sleep and shower without breaking the bank, and Hector's place delivered. Check-in was a breeze and proximity to the T and Logan Airport made getting around Boston easy. "
12308927,116221427,2016-11-28,70059184,Mina,Very clean. Close to public transport. Very affordable for location. Interactions with Hector were great as well. 
12308927,116334010,2016-11-29,34803340,Seetharam,Perfect for airport transfer. Hector has given correct info for me to reach the place. The room ready as promised. Did have time to interact.  Accommodation was clean and tidy. 5 star.
12308927,116452633,2016-11-30,70888690,Jay,"Hectors place was exactly as he stated - a cosy little room close to the T station. Very easy to get to Logan via the train to Airport station (1 stop), then the free shuttle bus to the terminal. There are plenty of shops and restaurants on and around Sumner Street, so eating and drinking is easy.

Great place, would recommend for proximity to the airport. Also, you can get a water taxi from just down the road to downtown Boston, so if you fancy something different, just do it!"
12308927,116786075,2016-12-03,29544379,Vinh,"This is a perfect place for a solo short stay with everything you need- no more, no less. The location is perfect, very close to the Maverick T station so you can go anywhere in Boston from here. My only complaint was a tapping sound that came from the walls in the middle of the night right by my bed that interrupted my sleep. Not sure what caused it. I'd recommend staying here for the best value stay in Boston."
12308927,117332449,2016-12-06,56102366,Ali,Exactly like the pictures! Cozy and convenient!

12308927,121137875,2016-12-14,27690159,Lilou,Nice room walking distance from the T station.  Ideally placed for the airport but also on the same line to downtown Boston for shopping and restaurant.  Hector is a friendly guy and apartment very neat and tidy.
12308927,127021278,2017-01-15,105795732,Sunny,Very kind host! Deserve 5 stars and the name of great host. I like everything here. Perfect cozy home.

12308927,134229736,2017-02-26,115694475,An,Hector is an amazing host. Very kind and willing to help you if you have any questions about the city. I highly recommend you go to him and pick his brain for all the invaluable information he has on Boston and what all the best places are to go to.
12308927,135138711,2017-03-03,99322294,Antoni,"Practical area, cute place! Would recommend! Thanks Hector"

12308927,136885596,2017-03-12,63832793,Vale,"This place is really good. Close to the subway, airport, groceries, restaurants. Really quiet. "
12308927,137459326,2017-03-15,118269804,Yimin,The house is as cozy as Hector described. The location is just next to the subway station. Hector is a very nice man. I will choose to live here again next time I go to Boston.
12308927,140539880,2017-03-30,118718358,Ari,Excellent place to stay close to the airport and public transit. 
12308927,175731700,2017-07-29,81959520,Sarah,"CLEAN, CONVENIENT, COMFORTABLE, AFFORDABLE!!!! What else you can ask for an airbnb stay? This place is so close to the TRAIN, buses and water taxi. Only one stop to the airport and two stops to downtown. A lot of Spanish and Italian restaurants around here. Grocery store just across the street. Burger King and DD at the corner. 
Hector is a very nice guy. He welcomed me when I got in. Helped me with the luggage. And offered me a bottle of water. They even have a bunch of brochures for things to do in Boston. 
The bed is just so comfortable. I notice the apartment has been refurbished and looks even better than the picture. It is very handy to have a writing table and charging station right next to the bed. 
The place is definitely worth the money and best choice if you want to find a clean and comfortable place close to the airport and downtown, then Hector's place is your best choice!!
I will definitely book again. 
"
12308927,180204962,2017-08-09,97928588,Santiago,"Hector is truly a super host, he'll greet you with water and will always be attentive to your needs. The room is close to the maverick station and it has various shops around it. I would totally recommend Hector's room."

12308927,183205733,2017-08-16,19263728,Sebastian,"Hector was a great host, although we never met on my 2-day-trip to Boston. He was also eager to answer all of my questions regarding Boston in generell or the neighborhood. 

The room was small, but cozy like suspected. The location is great. Via subway you are either in downtown Boston or at the airport in no time. 
If you want to explore Boston, this might be the perfect place for you."
12308927,183540884,2017-08-17,36239115,Andrea,Hector is a great host who offered very helpful eating and transportation info.

12308927,187227094,2017-08-26,66224976,Paddy,I had a very enjoyable stay with Hector. The apartment is very comfortable and clean. It's a 5 min. drive to the airport so it's a good location to stay if you arrive in a late flight or need to catch an early one.
12308927,187763047,2017-08-27,141691728,Raffaele Pio,"Nice place, close to the airport."
12308927,188228326,2017-08-28,44066985,Layne,"This was a convenient and comfortable place to stay. Hector provides clear check-in instructions, including a video demonstrating the procedure for key retrieval. I didn't meet Hector (or any other hosts or guests) during my stay, but we still communicated easily as needed through Airbnb. There was plenty of space in the fridge, and a towel was provided. The apartment itself was quiet, although the footsteps from the apartment above were very audible during the daytime. It was quiet at night, however. There are a few shops and restaurants within walking distance. I would stay here again!"

12308927,190957852,2017-09-05,37081487,Vidya,It's very close to the airport and Maverick station. It's an entire town home with access to the second floor (one flight of stairs). Communication and check-in was very efficient. Hector gives you access to the kitchen and the living room on that floor. I would stay here again since it's super close to the airport.
12308927,191464871,2017-09-07,139594553,Julien,Hector was a good host. We communicated efficiently via the app. His place is a good spot if you have to reach the airport early in the morning since it is 1 station away. The place is clean and you have the essential.
12308927,192038682,2017-09-09,50491408,Chihsheng,Nice location
12308927,193447990,2017-09-13,8760219,Gail,Hector was very nice and super informative about Boston. The room was better than expected and very close to the T.

12308927,198487204,2017-09-29,149331523,Kyoungsoo,"Great accessibility to the airport and subway station. Each room is small but clean and cozy. Hector is a very nice and friendly person. The neighbor on the first floor was also very helpful. If you are not traveling with a lot of baggage, and need a quiet place to stay near public transportation, I would definitely recommend this place."
6823017,53169859,2015-11-06,37140050,Connor,The listing was exactly as described.  Yi was an amazing host and extremely helpful while staying there.  I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again.  Thank you again Yi.
6823017,54255274,2015-11-17,28090652,Tian,Yi's place is very clean. All the other roommates were very nice as well. He's also a great host and tried to provide me with everything that I needed. 3 min walk to the bus that can get you to Harvard University. 15 min walk to HBS. Great value for anyone who is visiting HBS. 
6823017,54924101,2015-11-25,34616022,Kushani,"Yi and Nancy were the best hosts we have had so far. They were so polite an considerate at every stage. They offered everything to us from bottled water, to extra chairs, and even disposable cutlery and paper plates. The room was at par with a very good hotel room, it was immaculately clean. Both bathrooms were also extremely clean at all times, with high quality toiletries provided for us along with good quality towels. Over and above all this, the conversations we had with everyone who lived in the house were so good; they made us feel like we were home 7000 miles away from home. 
I highly recommend staying with Nancy and Yi, they are the best hosts!"
6823017,56636460,2015-12-15,27664327,Genna,The place was true to its listing. Perfect for a short trip to Boston to see a concert. Joe was very accommodating when we needed an iron and extra towels. The room is spacious and fits an air mattress with plenty of room to still move around.
6823017,59229920,2016-01-08,48015585,Beata,Big clean rooms and friendly hosts in a nice part of Boston. Definitely worth a visit!
6823017,59737487,2016-01-14,5191980,Jennifer,"Joe was very accommodating! It was a very nice room as per the pictures and the heater in the room was a lifesaver, the room was well insulated but the heater made it extra comfy staying there!

The room was exactly like it looked on the Pictures, all very clean and tidy. - and the bed was very compfy, too!

6823017,85454682,2016-07-11,34316965,Elizabeth,"Everything was fine. The floors, though beautiful were crunchy with something. The mattress was wonderful. It is a nice house and very convenient for our needs. Didn't meet Joe (didn't expect to) so I can't comment on him but the room was fine"

6823017,97668541,2016-08-28,72288852,Tamara,"The room is in a house full of other rooms that are also offered on Airbnb (at least 7 in total). So it's more like a hostel or motel than a real Airbnb. It was clean, has AC and offers enough space for two people.
There are two bathrooms and a kitchen and the host provides a couple of free things to his guests (shampoo, conditioner, cold water to drink, etc.).
Joe is a nice guy who replies quickly and manages a smooth system to hand you the keys.
As long as the hostel/motel style doesn't bother you, this Airbnb is highly recommendable."
6823017,98966950,2016-09-02,88547881,Macide Ece,"My father and I stayed at Joe's house for 5 nights. During the entire stay, Joe was a very accessible, helpful and warm host.

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay in Boston and at his house. Thanks again, Joe! "

6823017,106331921,2016-10-05,79337388,Gloria,"Everything was straight forward and pretty simple; i easily found my way around the house. Even though the bathrooms were shared, they were always clean - which is great. It was also convenient for me to access the public transport that I needed to get to my school. I also appreciated that on the check-out day, Joe let me keep my suitcases in a secure backroom until later in the evening when I could pass by and take them on the way to the airport."
6823017,106490340,2016-10-06,21063325,Oscar,Es una ubicación ideal para ir a Cambridge

屋主人非常好!
晚上實在找不到洗衣機(因為在地下室),屋主還特地帶我去!
地點離地鐵站稍遠了些,不過附近有公車站,坐公車也能到市區、MIT等等。
附近小區蠻安靜的,若是要找波士頓住宿可考慮這裡"
6823017,107818332,2016-10-12,95182328,Sarah,"My friend and I stayed here for a few days during our stay in Boston. It was clean, and easy to find, and close to a bus stop that we used quite often to get around in the city ( the place itself is a bit far from major things going on in the city but the bus is very easy to take). The bed was comfortable, and everything was tidy when we arrived. The only issue was that one day the key wouldn't work in the door because the top lock was locked, but we eventually got it to work and Joe was quick to respond if ever we had questions. "
6823017,108121192,2016-10-14,41696359,Adonis,"-离66路公车有约5分钟的走路路程,66路貌似是哈佛地区主要的公交通勤之一;如果是在波士顿自由行,需要地铁和公交搭配起来乘坐。如果再往北走远5分钟,就有最近的Hubway租自行车的地点。
-房间位于2层,上楼前在楼梯里有鞋柜,房间和公共地区都非常整洁,洗手间有两个,有比较宽敞的厨房餐厅,在这里基本上提供一切旅行必要生活所需。
-房东Joe业主在这里,如果有对当地的疑问,他非常立意给出建议。"

He was super accommodating to my schedule, the room and bed were big, everything I needed was stocked in the bathroom and all in all the communication was great all around. Really central location in the Boston area too - close to everything! Highly recommend"
6823017,109867362,2016-10-23,13572711,Alex,"Joe was very helpful in getting us settled.  He picked me up from the airport.  Nice place, boarding house style.  Stays quiet, clean, and the kitchen is full enough to cook.  Close to Harvard square."
6823017,110167404,2016-10-24,82378608,David,"This was my first time in a shared-bath Airbnb and it was fine.  Joe's place was super clean and the building and the street was very quiet.  During the Head of the Charles weekend when discount hotel rooms were $200+, this was a great deal.  Having a locked room for my suitcase before check-in time was a major reason for me choosing this location and it worked out perfectly."
6823017,110351284,2016-10-25,100540999,Wei,"This is my very first time using AirBnB. I initially scheduled to stay one night but I have extended my stay by one more night twice already :) So far everything is great. I met Joe and his wife, nice people. Everything looks clean and the location is good and there is plenty of parking space. Highly recommend."

よかったのは以下の点です。
コストパフォーマンスがいい
オーナーが親切、返信がとても早い
場所が安全、清潔

お風呂の清潔さについてのコメントが見受けられますが、
十分な清潔さが保たれて居ました。

ドアの鍵の開け閉めに少しコツがいるので、はじめにオーナーさんに聞くといいと思います。"
6823017,116456587,2016-11-30,105510768,Cory,"Nice place, 2 shared bathroooms; however the house is right on I-90, which may cause issues for light sleepers."
6823017,116558788,2016-12-01,6885361,Anoop,"Joe's place was great ! 

I had an appointment at Harvard Business School and needed a place for a night that was close by.

Joe's place is a quick cab ride to campus.
Room was clean, private.
Bathroom was well stocked ( which was good because I forgot to pack my stuff !)

Overall it was a great experience 

"
6823017,121127180,2016-12-14,1226736,Chris,I stayed for two weeks and this Airbnb earns 5-stars! Joe is running an amazing place. Floor is clean. Kitchen is organized. Bathrooms look brand new. The room is fantastic and very comfortable. The bedding is much cozier than I expected and that made me really happy. I highly recommend this room for any length of stay.
6823017,121379049,2016-12-16,106548955,Michael,"Great room, bathroom is well kept, and great wifi and TV access. Only downside for non-student visitors is that it is not exactly central, and takes a bit of work to get in town. However it's proximity to Harvard is great for students. Joe is incredibly responsive and an extremely effective host. Overall great place to stay!"
6823017,121688456,2016-12-18,67256813,Alexis,"Great place! Super clean home with a well stocked bathroom and room, and lots of privacy. I would totally stay here again next time I'm in the area! "

6823017,124743655,2017-01-02,76921108,Alex,Joe's place is just as described with a super comfortable bed and a lot of room. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to Harvard Square and the subway which easily gets you in to town. Joe was also incredibly helpful when I accidentally locked my keys in my room! Definitely worth the stay here!
6823017,127708127,2017-01-20,101977668,Maria,"Joe's place is great and conveniently located. It is just as described. The free shampoo, coffee and water are very much appreciated. I also loved that I had access to the fridge and stove, and storage space for my food.

The bus is really by, so it is convenient to get to Harvard."
6823017,129556118,2017-01-31,26051751,Tony,"Centrally located close to restaurants and bars, secluded enough to not hear the busy nightlife but close enough to be within walking distance."

The unit was well-kept and we rarely saw any of the other guests staying. We never interacted with Joe, but he ensured that we were taken care of with his good communication. "
6823017,143188076,2017-04-10,33597985,David,"We didn't see Joe during our stay, but we found everything as expected: easy check-in and decent room. 
Could be a bit too noisy for some guests, since you will hear the busy I90 even if the windows are closed. But this probably also depends on which room in the apartment you'll get. Since the price was relatively high (room was ok, but definitely nothing special), only 3 stars for ""value""."
6823017,144099466,2017-04-14,24910456,Eliezer,Boa.
6823017,145522560,2017-04-18,115020210,Louise,"This was our first experience of Air B&B and we didn't know what to expect but Joe's place was exactly as advertised and even exceeded expectations in some areas.

Thank you Joe."
6823017,145913379,2017-04-20,35878002,Jessica,Joe was easy to communicate with and flexible in scheduling my arrival.  Very close to Harvard and BU.

6823017,147805426,2017-04-28,32343182,Maroine,"As described, the location is great to get to Harvard, the room and apartment are clean. It's also easy to communicate with Joe. However, the room that I've booked (room A) is in front of the highway which generates some noise affecting my sleep."

The home is really comfortable and well connected with the bus stop to Harvard Square. In the house you can use the wash machine  (but paying), kitchen and two baths. 
"
6823017,150666581,2017-05-08,64631928,Avi,Straightforward check-in instructions. Quick Uber ride to HBS campus. Room A is adjacent to a shared bathroom and could potentially get loud if you are easily woken up by noises - bring earplugs! Other than that no issues and a great stay.
6823017,152966400,2017-05-19,38325253,Arianna,"A simple place, basic furniture, but complete with everything you need, for cooking as well. It's a quiet place and the owner is very nice. "

6823017,153698314,2017-05-21,23917540,Andrew,"Joe's place is in a great location and for the price, it couldn't be beat, especially since it was during graduation weekend. He was super easy to communicate with and was really helpful in letting me leave my car there before my check in and after my check out while I ventured through Boston. The space was really clean, and despite it being a shared space, it felt very private. Towels were provided, there was TV/WiFi, and even a water dispenser for public use. I'd definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable place to stay near Boston."
6823017,154666850,2017-05-25,34319096,Travis,"Big house with parking! Stayed in room ""A"". Comfy bed, restroom right next to the room. Wish our stay in Boston was longer than just a day so we could have stayed longer.  Thanks Joe!"

Check in/out was easy. The house, bedroom and bathrooms were well kept. We were lucky to meet Joe, he was very welcoming and friendly. Would stay again if we are back in Boston! "
6823017,156922366,2017-06-01,121399791,Jack,"A good temporary place for an out-of-state intern while looking for a permanent summer apartment. I only saw Joe once, but he was very friendly. There was a fridge with plenty of space for me to use, a big comfy bed, and a nice bathroom. I was able to walk to work and a grocery store. Overall, a nice place. I'd consider staying again if I was on a short-term visit to Boston. "

His place is very close to bus number 66, which takes you to Harvard Sq and from there you can straight towards downtown. Even though a little bit pricey but it was totally worth it. "

6823017,170109078,2017-07-14,2829595,Jon,"A clean, convenient, and great value accommodation. WiFi is solid, only critique would be the very white flourescent light in the room (although there was a lamp with warmer light available) if that is a concert. Keep in mind that this there are some common areas (kitchen, restroom) but all were kept very clean and had absolutely no issues. "
6823017,172342653,2017-07-20,19803629,Morgan,Great room in lovely respectful house! Bathrooms and kitchen were great too 
6823017,173907965,2017-07-24,34763666,Carriey,"This place is very good! I booked it for my parent's three day visit there, and we are signed to one of the room. Although the whole building has several different people living in different rooms, my parents find no problem with that. And even with a share bathroom, we don't find any problem with that. The only thing is that because of a little illness of my dad's right foot, it was a little bit inconvenient with the stairs, but it's not a huge problem. Just let you know, to take that into account if any of you travelling is not that comfortable with using stairs. Others are wonderful, walking distance to bus 66 to Harvard square, and very quite community!!"
6823017,174356005,2017-07-25,131794529,Goda,"Everything was great except the check-in. I was given a wrong code for the lock so I was not able to enter the house. Despite of this fact the room was very clean, cozy and I enjoyed staying there."
6823017,175359554,2017-07-28,9965680,Sarah,"Nice, easy, and comfortable place to stay near Harvard Business School."
6823017,177069892,2017-08-01,134217912,Nobuko,"Overall I had a very comfortable and relaxing time at Joe's place. He had been very supportive whenever I asked him questions.  Reasonable room when considering the location and easy to access by bus. Less than 5min walk from the nearest bus stop, Hooker street.  Room was clean and air-conditioned and enough storage provided. 
Several kinds of shampoo & conditioner and body soap supplied at the shower rooms (actually there are two bathrooms on the floor I stayed), but no wash cloth. Very clean shared places; kitchen, bathroom, and hall way. Also, other people at his place were very quiet and polite. I used laundry machine and dryer, and it was very helpful.  I'd like to come back to his place if I have another chance to visit Boston.  Thanks Joe."
6823017,177411377,2017-08-02,48257290,Jesse,Stayed one night and it was super easy to check in and check out

6823017,185764170,2017-08-22,138770001,Thomas,Perfect location for our purposes. Smooth downtown as well as university campus commute (car or public transportation).Room very clean with sufficient space. Bathrooms and kitchen fit for the intended use. Joe was always available if requested.
6823017,186440846,2017-08-24,6273097,Bruno,"It's an option with excellent cost-benefit in Boston.
Very clean, practical place in a great, well located neighborhood. There are rules and they are very fair; follow them and you'll have a great stay here."
6823017,186800098,2017-08-25,117677823,Delfina,Cosas malas y buenas. Nos despertamos y habia una raton en el pasillo el cual tiene conexion a la cocina. No sabemos si no estuvo entre la comida. Las sabanas estaban manchadas. Lo bueno es que El barrio es muy bonito y esta cerca de Harvard y que nos permitió dejar  las valijas antes del check in.
6823017,187787955,2017-08-27,15859020,Riccardo,"La comunicazione con Joe è stata molto semplice e lui è stato gentilissimo e sempre pronto ad aiutarci. La casa è molto accogliente e la stanza ha tutto ciò che serve per soggiornare serenamente. Noi eravamo in macchina e la posizione per noi era perfetta, vicino ad harvard ma non lontana da Boston. Ottima sistemazione!!"

4020650,19061564,2014-09-05,20787060,Ray,"Great place, similar system to a hotel. Definitely recommending this place for people in need of a space. The wifi never ended working for me, so I hope they can fix it for next time."
4020650,19300074,2014-09-09,16087091,Francesca,"I rented this small studio for a friend visiting me in Boston. The studio was just perfect: simple and clean, in the middle of the most amazing and elegant neighborhood of Boston. The place is just for a person and it has all you need for a short vacation in Boston. The host was professional and he always replied to my requests and questions. "
4020650,19702327,2014-09-16,647968,Patricia,"The studio is exactly as described: a nice, clean place to stay while in town.  Its also in a great neighborhood, couldn't ask for anything else.  I would definitely stay there again.  "
4020650,19802498,2014-09-18,21215920,Somer,"This studio was perfect for my business trip. It is on a nice quiet street just steps to newbury for all of your shopping and dining needs. Would probably be too small for more than one, but was clean and quiet. Easy picking up the keys, wifi worked great, no complaints!"
4020650,20042987,2014-09-22,2919633,Dipan,Gr8 location and easy communication.
4020650,20299576,2014-09-27,576078,John,Amazing location and very clean. 
4020650,20617611,2014-10-02,20955626,Omar,"Similar to a motel setup, reasonable room at a reasonable price. Getting the key 2 blocks away in light drizzle with luggage was little inconvenient for me."
4020650,21085866,2014-10-11,4859566,Jerry,Nice little apartment. Not big on amenities but a GREAT location in a wonderful neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again.
4020650,21221189,2014-10-13,13342016,Sonia,"The studio was comfortable, clean and in an amazing location. Perfect for a short trip to Boston. "
4020650,21349531,2014-10-15,13341624,Marc,"It was easy to pick up the key and drop it off. 

The apartment was what I expected. It's like a small hotel room. Not bad!"
4020650,21441428,2014-10-17,1643020,Jim,"You get what you pay for, I suppose. 
Pluses. 
-great location
-good price
-thank you for accommodating my early checkin
Cons
-lock didn't work and no one came to fix it until the next day. I notified the office well within normal business hours when the lock stopped working. Contacting me with what time the person was going to fix the lock would have been better than just having him barge into the apartment.  
-very dusty apartment 
-there was an odor that was unpleasant. Perhaps new carpet or none at all would help. 
-don't think it was mentioned in the listing that the property was a ground floor apartment. 
-some street noise and quite a bit of noise from remnants going in and out of the building. 
-the sheets need replacement. They are old. 
-same goes for the pillows. They are terribly cheap. "
4020650,21664141,2014-10-21,5319091,Bob,"Very easy to work with and everything was as advertised.  Note that if you think you can stay in downtown Boston for $89 you aren't looking for 5-star accommodations.  Bernie's place worked well for me and I'd stay there again, but feel it appropriate to add some details to the description.  This is for one person, or two that need little room and have no modesty issues.  $89/nt should be the top price.  The furniture and condition is serviceable, nothing more, and it's clean.  The shower is small and the stall is about 18"" above the floor - you step up into it and the step down would present a challenge to a person with any limitations on mobility.  The apartment is street level next to the front entry to this brownstone, so there is some noise, but the residents are not a rowdy bunch.   The key is at the office a couple hundred yards away and the T is about 6 blocks away, so a cab is a good idea in poor weather."
4020650,21958829,2014-10-27,21063648,Kevin,I thought the place was great! Really easy to find and in an awesome location! The cost was fair although the place was a bit dirty.
4020650,22190118,2014-11-01,1700730,Wendell,"Location is good.  About a 10 minute walk to the Prudential Center and a nice neighborhood though not convenient to public transportation or places frequented by visitors.

Please note the other reviews regarding the noise from other people who live in the building.  You can literally feel their foot steps as they walk by and haul their bags up the stairs.  Also, when the mailman slams the mailboxes shut as they are on the other side of the bed (loud noise made me jump).

Last note: there is no heating.  There is a hot water pipe that goes from floor to ceiling in one if the corners, but it was sufficient to overpower the draft coming in around the window-style air conditioner.

The place has clean sheets and towels as well as decent Wi-Fi.  Other than that, it was quite run down (mold in the shower door, missing on old dresser, cracks in the door jamb that you can see through, long blonde hair everywhere).

In conclusion, as long as your expectations are properly set, the price is fair for the area.
"
4020650,22430020,2014-11-06,21785768,Robert,"Never met a host, but key pick up was easy.
They were nice enough to let me in a couple of hours early, as I had a early arriving flight.
The place is, surely, nothing fancy, but was perfect for my needs, as I was out and about most of the time. Internet was fine, TV also.
Fantastic, safe location in a great neighborhood. I would definitely return."
4020650,22491349,2014-11-08,881066,Joseph,"Great location in Back Bay. It makes it easy to see the main sites in Boston and Cambridge. The place is as advertised. The only thing to be aware of is noise. This unit is beside the main entrance of the building and the walls don't offer much of a sound barrier. I'm a fairly deep sleeper but I was awoken both mornings I was there by the sound of the front door closing as people left the building. That said, at this price point (low) in this location (great), I'd still recommend the place to a single traveler that's looking for a no-frills option. "
4020650,22752424,2014-11-13,21773644,Andrea,"Sistemazione ideale per chi viaggia da solo e deve fermarsi pochi giorni a Boston!
L'appartamento è molto piccolo, ma essenziale: letto, bagno, collegamento internet, TV, micro onde, macchina per il caffè. Se cercate il lusso lasciate perdere.
La posizione è ottima: se vi piace camminare potete raggiungere comodamente tutto le attrazioni, altrimenti le fermate della metropolitana sono poco distanti."
4020650,22886640,2014-11-17,3471761,Kevin & Yuan,"This AirBnB is run by a fellow who also runs an actual B&B just down the road.  It is just about the best value you are likely to find in the Back Bay. 

The place is very small but reasonably well appointed with a good shower, bathroom, and small kitchenette (no oven) but a fridge, counter, and cups.  

There were however a few drawbacks.  First, this place is street level and, although the street is quiet, it is very loud when people enter and leave the building.  The stairs go right over the room and it literally sounds like thunder when people climb them.  For sensitive sleepers, take caution.

Also, its cold.  There is a pipe the provides heat, but it cannot compensate for the two large single pane windows behind the bed.  A space heater here would do wonders. 

There were a couple of other minor issues, two of which admittedly, had I brought up with the host would have been rectified.  First, the lock was broken and hard to use.  Second, the internet was very very slow - my cellular data was faster.  Third, parking in the Back Bay is VERY EXPENSIVE, like 30 to 40USD for a 24 hour period.  Some hosts will provide guest residential parking permits, this is something to take into consideration when booking, even if it means a more expensive room tariff.
"
4020650,23062301,2014-11-22,17350193,Jeremy,"Location. Location. Location. This room is in a great location in the Back Bay neighborhood. A quick walk to shops, restaurants, the Hynes Convention Center and the Cheers Bar!  It is, as advertised, a very small room--but great for one person. And Bernie was great to rent from."
4020650,23150381,2014-11-24,6543977,Eric,"This studio apartment worked well for a quick stay in Boston.   It was very easy to pick up the key (the office is a few blocks down the street) and the staff was very accommodating (I arrived early and was able to store my luggage for the entire day until I was done with a conference).  The apartment itself is quite basic but had hot water and central heating - this was key as the outside temperature was in the 20's.  It was perfect for one person and is located within walking distance to many restaurants, cafes, shops, and museums."
4020650,23893224,2014-12-14,12335207,Eduardo,"I enjoyed staying in this small studio.  There is not much to say.  The listing description is accurate, the neighborhood is charming.  The host answered my queries promptly.  I recommend it and hope to book it again when I will be back to Boston."
4020650,25903855,2015-01-29,25346760,Carlton,"The description was for a very small studio.  With a studio I expected a cook stove, toaster, maybe a kitchen sink, and a fork, knife and a spoon.  None of those were included.  The description would  be more accurate stating a small room with 3/4 bath and a microwave and refrigerator.  Then the buyer would clearly know what they are purchasing."
4020650,28466510,2015-03-24,1658429,Alex,"Perferct small apartment for one person. Everything one needs, including wireless internet. No kitchen, but microwave present. Quiet building on beautiful street, walking distance to Prudential Center, Newbury Street, and other Backbay attractions. Train station 10-15 minute walk. Subways 5-10 minute walk. Effortless arrival and departure. Bernie is a great host. I will stay here again when visiting this part of Boston."
4020650,28758857,2015-03-29,2043542,Judith,"Great location!! Walkable!  The place is small but the space is very usable.  Comfortable to sleep, eat and use the bathroom/shower.  The heat in the building went off at night (at about 9) and didn't come on till after 7 AM.  I believe this is not controlled by the host, but it was cold at night  (It was under 30 degrees F outside and snowy! ) I am guessing that Bernie would have been happy to supply an additional blanket had I asked.  He was responsive in general and answered e-mails in good time.  In the dead of winter, picking up the key could be inconvenient, but all in all, this apartment was a great deal, a big bargain, and was more than adequate, right in the middle of the city!  I would definitely stay here again!  Thanks!!    "
4020650,29941892,2015-04-14,29188553,Pat,"The place was as advertised. It was very small, however, I didn't go to Boston to just sit inside all day. It was perfect for me. So if you don't plan on staying inside, this is the place for you. With in walking to some where as far as harpoon brewery but an even closer walk to some where like Fenway. It's in a great location. My only complaint is there is no way to control the temperature and the windows needed something to hold them up bc it got way to hot at night."
4020650,30107781,2015-04-17,6246018,Emmanuel,"The descriptions was perfectly accurate: small, clean room in a great location. The perfect crash pad!"
4020650,30459823,2015-04-22,24594014,Jon,"Well done! Clean, convenient, exactly as billed. Logistics of key pick up/drop off were easy. Would do this again."
4020650,30899474,2015-04-28,21063648,Kevin,This was my second time staying and it was just as good as before. Very reasonably priced and a good location. I would stay there again.
4020650,32003549,2015-05-12,14213106,Mark,It was located in an excellent neighborhood. Bernie was very quick in responding and very helpful.
4020650,32280526,2015-05-16,24551855,Matthew,Host was easy to deal with and apartment was in a great location.
4020650,33535336,2015-05-29,4046889,Nancy,"Studio was as described. Good location, easy to get around Boston."
4020650,33792037,2015-06-01,30381886,Mike,Description is accurate. Small space but in a great location. Good value if you aren't spending too much time in the room.
4020650,34791416,2015-06-12,33084704,Shai,"I stayed at Bernie's small studio for four nights during my visit to Boston. The studio was as Bernie described it, small but comfortable cozy and at an excellent location. My privacy was respected, and the interaction with Bernie was smooth through the app. I really enjoyed my stay at Boston."
4020650,39234911,2015-07-21,29334752,German,Es un cuarto pequeño en uno de los barrios más linds de Boston. Muy bien ubicado. El cuarto es un poco oscuro pero eso no importa si es que volves solo dormir. Cuenta con una heladera y un mínimo de vajilla. 
4020650,39789015,2015-07-26,36178852,Tse Yuen,"I did not Bernie himself but we kept in touch through e-mail. The arrangements for check in and out went well. As the studio is associated with the Beacon St Guest House just down the road, I called in there first. On my last day, as my flight was late at night, I checked out early but left my luggage at the Guest House for the day. The staff at the Guest House were very helpful and obliging.
The studio is billed as 'very small' but I found it quite alright - I certainly did not find it cramped or claustrophobic. There is a big window - adequately screened from the road by plants.  I appreciated the bathroom and the airconditioning. The room is very quiet. The microwave and iron+ironing board also came in useful. The wifi is fast too.
Excellent location - nice surroundings - about 10 minutes walk to Copley Station and the Back Bay stop for the bus to Logan airport outside the Hynes convention centre. Within about 5-10 minutes walk lots of restaurants, shops and cafes along Newbury Street. In the other direction, one can easily get to the banks of the Charles River - pleasant to walk in the early morning or evening."
4020650,43823431,2015-08-22,19106093,David,Second time I've stayed at Bernie's apartment. Definitely recommended (and will probably stay there again!).
4020650,45707692,2015-09-05,29712908,Timothy,"Bernie's place was great. A few blocks from the Copley and Hynes T stations. Great for short stays, and if you don't plan on doing any cooking."
4020650,46616641,2015-09-12,23371816,Shelley,"Do not stay in this place. 

My concerns started the first time I tried to contact Bernie after I booked. It usually took him more than one day to respond, but generally less than two. He would not give me information about how to get the key until a few days before I got there. He also did not answer all of my questions.

I had to get the key from a guest house, whose staff had never heard of him. It was a long walk with luggage.

The bottom sheet did not fit the mattress, there was long dark hair on the floor near the bathroom, the carpet had not been vacuumed, the shower head nearly broke off when I tried to adjust it, there was paint bubbling off the ceiling in the bathroom and when I went to use the towel, the towel rail fell off. It was very difficult to contact him about this - I went to the guest house to talk to him, but they had never heard of him. I tried to call him on his mobile phone, but that only got me through to the guest house. I had begun to wonder if he was a real person. I eventually was able to contact him and he said that the cleaners had been the day before, but he had not checked. They came again quite quickly, but there was still long, dark hair on the floor and again the carpet had not been vacuumed.

When I eventually was able to talk to him, he became quite argumentative. I did not like his manner. His level of customer service was zero.

The only thing this place had going for it was its location."
4020650,47366111,2015-09-18,5316310,Aitana,"The apartment was tidy and exactly like the listing: a very small apartment, but an apartment in any case, not a small room with a microwave... it was perfect for my purpose.  The location is superb, next to the river and next to the center, in a quiet road. I arrived late and had to pick up the key from down the road, from the guest house. It is a short walk, but if you're carrying luggage and come by taxi I would advice to ask the taxi to take you there first, and maybe even wait for you and take you to the other place, especially if the luggage doesn't have wheels."
4020650,48417346,2015-09-26,3521149,Tony,"The description on airbnb is accurate, small stuido with essentials, comfortable for a good rest, boutique building with hige ceilig and wooden doors, keys pick-up at a guest house close to Mass Ave about three blocks from the studio. Steve at the guest house was really helpful in answering my enquiries and arranging check out. Had a nice stay in Boston "
4020650,48726287,2015-09-28,2270338,Hubert,"The keys were easy to pick up from down the street and the location of the apartment was ideal, central to Boston's main attractions. To me, it's important to point out that this apartment may not be for you if you are a bit more particular about the details of your temporary home. Everything in the apartment appears to be quite old and/or of low quality (i.e. a chair that feels like it's about to fall apart, a comforter that's noticeably worn, and sheets/pillows that are low-quality). I genuinely didn't mind any of these things given the low cost of the rental, but I'd like to warn inquirers because I know some people who would've been extremely uncomfortable staying at this apartment. If these types of details mean a lot to you and you can afford a slightly more expensive rental, you should probably stay away. Although I don't regret my decision, I'm disappointed that it seems like the owner doesn't believe in making small investments in the property to improve guests' experiences. It would cost less than $500 to make significant improvements which would go a long way for guests."
4020650,49234061,2015-10-02,42479941,Patricia,"la ubicación es muy buena, pero al departamento le falta inversión, no esta al nivel que pretende."
4020650,49643033,2015-10-05,27240057,Dan,"No problems at all.  Great location, very small, exactly as advertised.  I got in late, so I had to pick up the key about a half mile away.  Communication was just fine."
4020650,50109955,2015-10-09,17827592,Travis,Great location!
4020650,50635670,2015-10-13,41330988,Greg,"I enjoyed by stay at Bernie's studio.  Just as stated, it is a small studio really only suitable for one. Two individuals would fit but a little cramped.  As a single traveler it was perfect size for me and I didn't plan to spend lots of time inside.  The location is great! Walking distance to great selection of shopping and restaurants and to public transportation.  If you looking for shiny and new, this may not be the place for you.   If you are elderly or have accessibility issues be warned that there are several steps into the building (as lots of places in Boston do) and there is a funky step up into the shower."
4020650,52112933,2015-10-26,4272338,Tim,"The studio is small, but very well located in the lovely Back Bay. It was convenient and comfortable. As others have mentioned, it is as advertised and probably best for one person who is looking to get out and explore Boston. I look forward to my next stay. Communication with Bernie was easy, and when at the last minute I needed a late Check out - Bernie was able to accommodate me right away."
4020650,53894209,2015-11-14,10388239,Alexandra,"The studio is exactly as advertisd and it was just perfect for me - great location in Back Bay and only half an hour walking distance from MIT. It has all essentials that are needed. Just two minor issues: as it is an old house and the apartment is right next to the entrance, it sounds as if people are standing right next to your bed when they are entering or leaving the building; and I couldn't find anything to turn up the heating systems and felt a little cold most of the time (but I usually need it warmer than most people, so others shouldn't have much trouble with that). Would definitely stay there again next time!"
4020650,54162882,2015-11-16,6276808,Stuart,"The studio is definitely small, but clean and comfortable with nice add-ons, especially considering the size, including fridge, microwave, internet, and TV. The location is great and I would be happy to stay there again. Make sure to email/call ahead of time, since you may need to pick up your keys a couple of blocks away."
4020650,54875776,2015-11-25,46706180,Sidharth,"Decent small studio, exactly as described. Close to Hynes Convention Center, MIT and Copley. Keys are collected and dropped off two blocks away. Bernie's response is prompt and professional. "
4020650,55728172,2015-12-05,4055496,Yijue,"Really nice location and convenient, clean, and cozy. For a single person stay in Backbay, this is the perfect choice. "
4020650,67913426,2016-04-01,15224285,Manny,"As other reviews have mentioned, this unit is associated with a local guest house (where you check in/out). I never actually met Bernie, but he was prompt in email communication. Unit is small, and not the most fancy, but certainly comfortable enough for a short stay. It's more affordable than a hotel, and conveniently located for access to public transportation and interesting things in the city. "
4020650,70682611,2016-04-19,25474623,Philip,The room is small as accurately described in the listing. the neighborhood (Brownstones) is killer.  5 minute stroll to shops and food. i had a great stay. thanks Bernie
4020650,72044129,2016-04-30,39311211,Matt,It's accurate that the place is very small essentially a single room with a very small shower room off one end but it fitted my needs well. It had basic appliances fridge microwave coffee machine enough to have some flexibility but not a full kitchen. It's in a great location in Back Bay within easy walking distance of the T with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby and an easy stroll out to the river. I enjoyed my stay.
4020650,75632875,2016-05-22,65515802,Tendai,The studio was a described in the listing and it is located in a very nice neighborhood in Boston. Check-in and check-out was smooth and host was willing to accommodate my schedule for the stay.
4020650,77888441,2016-06-04,41955161,Sarah,"The listing describes the apartment very accurately. The unit is small, but quite workable. The main reason to stay here is the neighborhood! It was absolutely adorable and tons of shopping and restaurants near by! Obviously you get what you pay for here, and while the unit has plenty of towels, cable TV, and internet, the connection is slow and the construction/furniture is a bit rickety. I also didn't notice if this was mentioned in the description but the unit is on the 1st floor with the large windows looking out to the street. There is a large hedge in front of the window for some privacy, but it still made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Overall quite satisfied with this unit though and the location is great."
4020650,78081480,2016-06-05,1676003,Patricio,"A little confusing on how to get the keys, apartment is enough, and location is perfect."
4020650,80106992,2016-06-16,27032790,Ben,"Accurate description - this is a smaller studio apartment, situated in a fantastic location minutes walk from the city hubs.  Grocery store is nearby, as are several excellent restaurants. Quiet area with minimal traffic so a restful nights sleep.  "
4020650,82336938,2016-06-27,4272338,Tim,A second great stay - very convenient location!
4020650,86211385,2016-07-15,3676701,Margo,"This little apartment was a good spot for my busy work travel in Back Bay. Bernie was responsive and easy to deal with. Note: the bathroom doesn't have a real door, so better for 1 guest or 2 very close guests. "
4020650,86707188,2016-07-17,4763182,Michael,The listing descriptions accurate and the host was accommodating to last minute changes of my itinerary. I would gladly stay at this location again. 
4020650,87926262,2016-07-22,37995936,Ingrid,"The apartment was pretty close to ""as advertised."" Very small, but clean and a good location. The TV was a little tough to figure out -- would have been nice to have brief instructions re which remote to use.  It was affordable during a busy week in Boston, so the only real feedback I have is that my experience would have been greatly improved by softer sheets. I don't think the sheets were old or cheap, just really scratchy. :) Thanks Bernie! You were very nice and responsive when I emailed. "
4020650,90972399,2016-08-03,50162416,Hector,"Todo es como describe el aviso. El check-in fue muy fácil. El apartamento está muy bien ubicado. Lo único que debe mejorar es la señal del WiFi, es muy débil."
4020650,91270272,2016-08-04,14498070,Mathew,"For budget stays close to Copley, this was a good choice.  It's a bit of a walk if you're carrying bags, especially if you need to pick up the keys, but otherwise the studio was definitely convenient, the space is perfect for one person, and I appreciated the free wifi.  It could use a little freshening up, but it worked for my little business trip. Thanks, Bernie!"
4020650,92140778,2016-08-07,55982342,Carina,Location was perfect! Would definitely recommend this place.
4020650,92661299,2016-08-09,87446759,Pierette,"Apartment exactly as described.  Beautiful building and the neighborhood is amazing!
Quiet, too. 
I would stay here again.
Perfect for business trips due to convenience of the area, Walgreens, CVS, Trader Joes-all a few blocks away.
There is a Sweetgreens, too! 
"
4020650,95132801,2016-08-18,1819540,Jessica,Good location for conference at the Sheraton in Boston.  The place looks a lot better than the photos provided on airbnb :)
4020650,97404324,2016-08-27,4027988,Laura,This studio is in a great neighborhood. Worked out really well for me with the local shopping and access to the T line so I could get over to the financial district for work. Bernie was very responsive to questions and providing details as to the key pickup/drop off
4020650,101279903,2016-09-12,41562787,Daniel,"The place is located in the Back Bay Area of the city. It's very convenient to a lot of shopping places and great restaurants.

This place is a direct match to the pictures shown. It's a very small studio.

The place could use a little dusting and some cleaning. I found some dust particles and hair almost everywhere.(in towels and bedding)

"
4020650,101859044,2016-09-15,4807867,Joel,"Great location.  BUT, remember this is much cheaper than a hotel, so you're not going to receive the same amenities.
Overall good value and conveniently located.   "
4020650,102156616,2016-09-17,43628074,Vanessa,"Perfect, popular spot for one person to base their Boston stay. Fantastic location, super convenient, cozy unit with compact refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. I found it to be an awesome deal in the Back Bay Area! Bernie was responsive and flexible. "
4020650,103643422,2016-09-23,70587992,Patricia,"As advertised it is a small place, about the same as a hotel room but on charming Brecon Street."
4020650,104625534,2016-09-27,86945428,Federico,Great location.
4020650,105651513,2016-10-02,5006190,Randy,Excellent listing! Everything went according to plan: from key pickup to wifi to check out. Actually it's not as small as other studios I've lived in (in Boston). The pictures are real and show the place well. 
4020650,109128541,2016-10-19,96205675,Sasha,"This is 110 sq ft place in the hallway of a multi-apartment building. It is substandard, noisy, has not been properly cleaned for a long time, the bathroom needs major repairs. The location is very good, character homes, lively streets, shops & restaurants, parks good neighbourhood. The keys need to be picked up two blocks away at 463 Beacon Street. Host available by e-mail, no services or clean linens provided. Cost is very high $169/night for this substandard housing. A person can stay there for a night of for a weekend and compromise, but it should not be rented long-term. "
4020650,112576933,2016-11-06,12834573,Matt,"A quick note to readers: since price is objective and potentially variable, I do not factor price into my reviews; instead, I describe the experience, and let readers draw their own conclusions about value. Also, this is not someone's living space: it's clearly used as a rental property and nothing else.  So if you're choosing Airbnb because you find hotel rooms sterile and lifeless, this place is not right for you: it's equally sterile & lifeless, but without the standard comforts that a hotel offers. 

Travelers arriving after 8pm should expect to walk to another property to pick up a key.  In my case the key was not there; the host was relying on other people to do that, and they didn't.  The host wasn't immediately reachable, but a surrogate responded to a phone call and drove in with the key (~20 minute wait), at which point you walk to the unit.  As a single male I felt fine, but I'm not sure I'd recommend this for a single female: lots of walking alone at night. 

The unit itself is largely as described, with the exception that the internet access is intermittent and the lighting feels like an electrical fire could happen pretty much any time.  The bed was comfortable but fairly short: I'm only 5'10"" and my feet were hanging off the end. "
4020650,114097990,2016-11-15,19126510,Alyson,Bernies place was a great find. It was very close to shopping and the convention center which my meeting was located. The room is the first floor right by the entrance so you could hear people entering and exiting but they were considerate and not loud. Bernie was extremely responsive throughout my stay in Boston.
4020650,115245483,2016-11-23,2500010,Chen,"Before I arrived, I was a little scared by the recent posts that were quite negative. Therefore I lowered my expectations. The description of the apartment was modest and accurate. It is as small as advertised. 

The neighborhood: there was one previous post saying that he felt that it could be uncomfortable for a  girl to walk alone on the street.  I was concerned of the safety before arrival, but it turned out to be fine. The neighborhood is actually very nice and I sometimes walked back around 11pm. Didn't have trouble at all. City center is within walking distance. 

Check in: you need to pick up the key from the guest house at 463 Beacon. If you don't like the self-service or you don't like walking, then it can be a problem. But the advantage is that you don't need to coordinate with the host in person. The staff at 463 were nice. For me, check in and check out was smooth. 

Cleanliness: it's unfair to say that the place is not clean. I would rather say that it is old and worn, which leaves the impression that it is not clean. The bathroom was quite OK, but the floor was not very clean. Also, only part of the room has carpet and it can be really cold to walk bare footed in the area without carpet.

Communication: Bernie was responsive but not as warm as other Airbnb hosts that I had in the past. It was not a problem per se, but it did affect my overall experience, as choosing airbnb over a hotel is not solely out of financial considerations. 

Heating: maybe because the apartment was old, I couldn't control the heater. I suspect that the heat came from the ceiling. As it became really cold in the last a few days during my stay,  I felt quite cold at night.

Internet: one previous post mentioned that the internet was intermittent. This is very accurate. Sometimes it is really slow: it can be tiring waiting for a webpage to load for 3 minutes. "
4020650,135614294,2017-03-05,47468681,Jeovani,"Simple, clean and  super close to everything you might need/want to visit. Perfect if you travel for business. I would book again."
4020650,136926463,2017-03-12,112884401,Debbie,"This studio is the perfect size for a solo traveler. The neighborhood is BEAUTIFUL and I would come back to Bernie's airbnb anytime I'm in Boston. The check in process was exactly as described and I got my keys without issue. Bernie was a little slow to respond to messages at times, but he still made sure everything was handled (I couldn't figure out how to get the TV working lol) which was great. Checkout went smoothly, the office has a nice little front room with coffee/tea and newspapers. Keep in mind that this airbnb is an older building, so obviously the amenities aren't brand new, but everything worked fine and was as described. I took pictures of the house and all my friends were jealous! It's a gorgeous neighborhood, close to the T and restaurants too. I hope to come back again when it's not snowing. :)"
4020650,142825034,2017-04-09,2795324,Erica,"As advertised, this is a small place, but it is well-located and comfortable. Check-in and check-out are very easy a couple blocks away at the main Guest House."
4020650,147808913,2017-04-28,10470570,Samantha,Small but adequate for 1 person. 
4020650,149291091,2017-05-03,44354077,David,Fantastic. Great host and place. Walking distance to many things and close to T for everything else. Can walk on streets at 3 am safely. Would definitely stay again
4020650,151977275,2017-05-14,101122959,Roger,This was just what I needed for my shorr trip to Boston.
4020650,152669980,2017-05-17,22713710,Jim,Space was central in Boston. 
4020650,154479823,2017-05-24,65510908,Donald,Great location - Back Bay is so cool. The room is small as advertised. Building was quiet. Had a mishap on the first night and I couldn't access the room key as instructed. However Bernie was in prompt communication and refunded the night. Second night was no problem.
4020650,156171149,2017-05-29,28586272,Darren,"The descriptions of the place and its amenities are accurate. It's small (as described), but good enough for up to 2 persons. It's location is great, within walking distance to Newbury St where there are shops and restaurants, and 1-block away from the Charles river. The check-in/out process was also smooth. Bernie contacted me ahead of time of the instructions for check-in and any updates. He's also very prompt in his replies."
4020650,157373128,2017-06-03,59607051,Angelica,"Walk friendly to everywhere I needed to visit in BackBay area. Important to me, My stay included towels, fridge, microwave, linens and soap. I prefer to bring my own soap for bathing to any overnight stay however. I could hang my clothes and enjoyed privacy. I would suggest clothes that are ready to wear and good walking shoes. Enjoyed my stay. "
4020650,158196368,2017-06-05,58255241,Len,"Had a great stay at Bernie's place, the location is exactly as described.  Best part about this unit is the location - very close to restaurants, coffee shops, and the river for running or walking.  Very quiet in the building - rarely ever heard any other noise which was great as well.  Will stay here again in the future!"
4020650,158641634,2017-06-07,73651362,Ryan,As advertised. Recommended. 
4020650,159750033,2017-06-11,107962767,Brian,"Worth it. If you like to explore a city on foot it's a great value.

You get exactly what you pay for and exactly what was advertised. It's a small, no-frills studio. I stayed by myself for 4 nights and it had everything I needed. If you're really tall the shower might be a bit small; I'm 5'6"" and it was fine for me. 

I didn't need any assistance during my stay but Bernie made it clear that he was available if I needed anything. Check in and check out were a breeze. 

What I really loved is the location. It's in a beautiful safe neighborhood in a great part of the city. You can walk to tons of shops, restaurants, bars, and historic sites. It's just across the Charles river from MIT and just a few blocks from Copley Square. "
4020650,165392625,2017-07-01,126175525,Linjie,"The location is very good and close to every thing. Bernie replies message very quickly. But the place and the facility is a little bit old, and ground floor is bit noisy. Overall, it is not bad for one person to live."
4020650,173088396,2017-07-22,127754987,Kanghee,Check-in and out system was very convenient. And Bernie gave me answers very quickly. It was very small studio but for me (one traveler) was not bad. But there were several problems for that room. First I can't find how to turn on the light and there was some bugs (cockroach and moth I think). That was the most annoying thing for me.
4020650,177734725,2017-08-03,142207862,Spring,Fantastic location. Good host with prompt communication. Space is as advertised.
4020650,179056501,2017-08-06,53172073,Terri,A good affordable place to stay in the heart of Boston where you can walk to everything.
4020650,181917108,2017-08-13,60124086,Rylan,"Pros: Good Location, quiet street/neighborhood, privacy, small refrigerator, and window air conditioner.

Cons: The apartment overall was not clean: there was a lot of dust, random stains on the walls, the shower smelled moldy, and the bed was not clean. I'm certain that the bed sheets, pillowcases, and blanket were not changed from at least the last person whom stayed before me. Also, the lighting in the room was very poor. 

With all the fees included, I ended paying about $154 a night for this Airbnb. I couldn't honestly say that the room was worth that much. However, the city of Boston was really fun, and the location of this Airbnb was really convenient."
4020650,183537608,2017-08-17,72532716,Bryan,It is as advertised a very small studio. If you're looking for a place just to sleep and close to the Fenway neighborhood this is your place.
4020650,184392107,2017-08-19,146334417,Shahem,Not what I expected
4020650,185807285,2017-08-22,94585544,Nick,"Fantastic location
Good value for Boston and especially the location
Broken toilet handle
Cobwebs in the corners
Hairs of previous renters
Right next to the loud entrance door
Noise from apartment above due to thin floors
Bed right next to window ac unit means noise from street if you go to bed early
Mosquitoes come in probably through the ac window

All in all a decent place"
4020650,187209196,2017-08-26,42081903,Culver,Bernie's place was exactly as described! It was the perfect location for everything I wanted to do!

4020650,193440190,2017-09-13,22056233,Sarah,Bernies place is exactly as described.  It is small with enough room for one person but perfect if all you need is a place to rest your head.  The location is superb on a beautiful street and very close to the oh so cool Newbury street.  A great base from which to explore.
4020650,194324732,2017-09-16,27994551,Dave,Convenient location. Small studio but enough for one person or even a couple. The place would need some TLC though. Did not get to meet Bernie. All communication was done through email but it all went seamlessly.
15181577,106689514,2016-10-07,98311108,Elle,"In the city for an event and needed a one night stay. There was a bit of a mixup around the lockbox - maintenance had left it inside! Maverick quickly sorted out the situation & even paid for my Starbucks - which is conveniently located across the street! Great location & lovely host! It's in a wonderful spot in the heart of Boston - close to shopping, subway, landmarks! I'd definitely book again - the private room is worth it! Thanks, Maverick, for the wonderful visit!"
15181577,107166633,2016-10-09,29048243,Jim,"It was pretty crowded.

We didn't understand the living room was being rented simultaneously.

Still a good deal, and a great location."
15181577,107957594,2016-10-13,88821391,Christopher,It's was conformable and sufficient for an over night stay. Maverick was very accommodating.
15181577,109940277,2016-10-23,43211276,Chisom,Great host and awesome location. I will certainly visit again. 
15181577,111277356,2016-10-30,9155070,Noel,"Excellent accommodation, location, communication, and convenience. Maverick made you feel at home away from home. Great interaction while he was around."
15181577,112027581,2016-11-03,19440537,Ciara,We were a bit confused when we walked in and saw someone was renting out the living room. It did get a bit crowded and I didn't want to walk through the living room to get to the kitchen or bathroom in the night and disturb them. Other than that we had a great stay in MJs room. The room is large enough for two and was nice and clean. The location was perfect. We walked everywhere we needed to go from the apartment. MJs room mate is a very friendly guy. 
15181577,112789544,2016-11-07,98434478,Charles,Host was away during the weekend but his roommate let me in and was very cordial. There are no complaints from my part
15181577,113126530,2016-11-10,75198143,John,"Basically sound but some room for improvement – these are not criticisms just suggestions to improve the experience of future customers.  It would be preferable if the private room had a lockable door. The shower takes way too long to get hot. No facilities for drying towels when 3 occupants were using one each per day. There is no chair/desk in the private room.  Maybe a facility to hang a temporary “do not disturb” sign on the  room door or some other reminder that the room could be occupied and therefore ask to keep down the noise.  There were odd bits of food in the fridge and on the counter top and it is not clear whether these are for general use, and should be replaced if used.

Overall, would stay thee again if these improvements were made. Great location for everything Boston.

15181577,113382301,2016-11-12,278874,Nick,"We had a nice stay in Maverick's room. It was clean and comfortable. The apartment's location is amazing. It's about as central as it gets in Boston and is just around the corner from Copley Square. One thing to note is that they also rent out the couches in the living room to guests, so you could be sharing the apartment with a few people."

We've already had multiple business meetings together and planning future collaboration overseas very soon!  You would miss out if you didn't get to know Mav & Sunny.  He bends over backward to accomodate guests and make sure their stay is wonderful.  Their apt is perfect for the area, soo much fun, & in the heart of high-end shopping and great restaurants.  You will have plenty to do if  you stay here!  Truly epic.  I'd move in if I was living in Boston full time!"

15181577,130370860,2017-02-05,16397721,Tina,The apartment was very neat and the bed in Maverick's place slept very well. The neighborhood is centrally located to shops and night life. You are really close to a train stop. We found it to be an absolutely charming place to lay our head while we were in Boston for a brief moment. 
15181577,130530839,2017-02-06,72536456,Jayashree,I really enjoyed my stay at Maverick's place. The room was very comfortable and the location is great. So close to the station and so many shops downtown. Host is very nice and showed me around Boston- I really appreciated it! Would stay here again when I'm in Boston next. 
15181577,130688647,2017-02-07,101109247,Rhiannon,"My boyfriend and I drove up to Boston on a whim for the Patriots Super Bowl parade. We live in DC so we had a very long drive up (8 hours!) and MJ was incredibly accommodating with our late check in. When we arrived, he was a gracious host - opening up his entire home to us and even hanging out for a bit & giving us suggestions for our very short trip. The bedroom was clean and cozy (with a super comfy bed!) and we thoroughly enjoyed our 1 night stay. Definitely recommend and will most likely stay again if we decide on another Boston trip :)"

15181577,137631772,2017-03-16,37382894,Nina,"I had a nice stay with Maverick and his flat mate Sunny. Maverick was hospitable. He even took me to the grocery store and prepared breakfast and dinner for us, as we were stuck at home due to a Blizzard. That was very kind of him and spending time with Maverick was fun, he is a friendly guy and so is his flat mate. The flat is beautiful and located in a very picturesque, central neighborhood with many shops and restaurants. The flat could be a bit cleaner overall, especially the fridge, the bathroom and the floor but Mavericks room was fine and the bed was clean and comfortable. The price is good for that neighborhood and I would recommend the place. "
15181577,139771671,2017-03-26,110840127,Veronique,"Wonderful location close to shops, restaurants and sightseeings...
Comfortable bedroom (although sometimes noisy from the nightly street activity), nice appartment in a lovely traditional/historical building. "

15181577,146634472,2017-04-23,95038924,Dante,"Maverick is a really nice guy and was very accommodating to us. He let us check in early since we were going to a wedding this weekend. Great location, a little loud (street and neighbors) but that's Boston. "
15181577,147555773,2017-04-27,7057279,Gaya,"I had a great stay at Maverick's place. The location of the apartment was amazing as it was right on Newbury Street. It was close to all the shops, restaurants and was right next to Copley sq station. The room & bathroom were both clean and the shared bathroom was always free whenever I needed to use it. I wouldn't hesitate to re-book to stay with Maverick again. "
15181577,148422391,2017-04-30,66464251,Jennifer,The best thing about this place is its super convenient location.
15181577,151344943,2017-05-12,19729023,Colin,This room rental is great for anyone looking for a central place to stay with a great selectuon of restaurants nearby and train line a short step away. Maverick was great at check in and with communication.He gave good suggestions on places to see and was always available for advice - yet never intrusive. The apartment was generally pretty quiet in the evenings which is exactly what I needed. Good value in arguably an expensive but awesome city. Thanks for the stay. 
15181577,152846842,2017-05-18,30126361,Katherine,really central location on amazing street in Boston. Maverick was also super responsive to messages and so friendly. Check in was seamless. Only thing was the neighbors and neighborhood can be a bit noisy in the early morning so might be an issue if you're a light sleeper or have a busy schedule and need a good night's rest
15181577,155100956,2017-05-27,57637113,Nathalie,"Maverick is a very nice host,  ready to answer all questions. The apartement is calm, in a beautiful building, in a central area of Boston. I would definitely recommend this place and I will come back to Maverick's apartment if I return to Boston !"
15181577,157138378,2017-06-02,10767536,Joey,Great spot to stay in Boston! Awesome host and super fun time! Highly recommend!

15181577,160117455,2017-06-12,125625549,Kristin,"The location is unbeatable! Close to the subway, bars and restaurants, shopping, parks, The Charles River Esplenade, and many historic and cultural sites. As other travelers have mentioned, the street noise was very loud and made sleeping difficult - especially on the weekend. I'd recommend ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. I appreciated that Maverick contacted me a few days in advance to make sure the directions and instructions were clear, and he was very responsive when I had questions. Maverick's place is a great find and I would definitely stay here again."
15181577,161035309,2017-06-16,132714555,Brad,"Maverick's place suited my needs perfectly.  I had long days scheduled for local business meetings in Cambridge and Boston.  So all I needed was a clean, comfortable centrally located place to come back to each night.  This place fit those requirements just right, without breaking my budget.  Easy access to the Green Line, lot's of local dining options.  And Maverick made the process easy, and communication was seamless."
15181577,176355508,2017-07-30,134940650,Karima,"I stayed 2 night in this location, and my week end was wonderful. This appartement is in the center and Maverick is a lovely host ready to help if need. His flat is clean and bright, I recommande without hesitations "

15181577,177691875,2017-08-03,24778788,Grace,Mavericks place is in a very nice location and very good value. Maverick is also a nice host and good communication. 
15181577,179071958,2017-08-06,5787254,Julien,"Well-locates apartment next by all the restaurants, shops and main attractions of the city. Would definitely come back!"
15181577,182838223,2017-08-15,43280922,Ryan,"Great place in a central location. Only stayed for about 12 hours, walked to Fenway, and got to the airport in the morning in 20 min"
3969526,19486188,2014-09-13,4808787,Marco,"Liesl's place is luxuriously large, fully appointed, and smack in the middle of the South End - surrounded by a full assortment of eating and drinking establishments (I made myself comfortable at Orinoco - a Venezuelan restaurant offering both tasty traditional and inventive fusion offerings), a little organic grocery, and all sort of walkable charm.  Easy to find, easy to get in, plus he kindly left some homemade granola!

I may have been Liesl's first ever airbnb-er, so I feel lucky - and would heartily recommend his place to anyone.   :)"
3969526,19631655,2014-09-15,17329155,Nick,"My family and I had a wonderful time visiting Boston and found Liesl's place to perfectly suit our needs. Everything was very clean, new, and comfortable, making for a great home away from home to return to after a long day in the city. Thanks Liesl! And the home made granola was delicious! "
3969526,19891858,2014-09-20,4808787,Marco,"Round 2 of my stay at Liesl's place, and cannot complain.  As before a streamlined experience, and a massive apartment surrounded by excellent amenities.  Would definitely stay again... and I did!"
3969526,20113170,2014-09-23,21083144,Jacalyn,"We really enjoyed our stay.  When we walked into the apartment we had fruit and granola ( made by our hostess!!! ) waiting for us. We felt very welcomed. 
The apartment was nicer than the pictures.  The beds were comfortable, and there was plenty of drawer and closet space.  
We also chose the apartment because of the location near our son and daughter-in-law.  We were literally around the corner!!! Could not beat the convenience!!!! 
Because my son and wife are expecting a baby soon we hope we will be able to stay at the apartment many times in the future when we come to visit.
The only thing I would add to this apartment is a coffee maker. The french press was nice but we enjoy perking a cup of coffee.
Everything else was perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
3969526,20312664,2014-09-27,18189670,Maria,"Communication with Liesl was a breeze..She was quick to respond to all emails and was so pleasant. She was very clear with check in/out instructions which made our stay completely stress free! The area that the apartment was in was great. We love the south end with all of its restaurants,  cafes and wonderful streets to wander down..Downtown is just a short walk if you are worried about not being in the 'center' of the city. The apartment was very quiet even though it is right near a hospital. We hardly ever heard any noise."
3969526,20437023,2014-09-29,4783770,Eric,Due to a fire at an air traffic control center out here in the Midwest my flight was cancelled so I never actually stayed at Liesl's place.  What was rather surprising was that the airline & the restaurants we booked both refunded any charges due to the unusual nature of the circumstances but Liesl was unresponsive to Airbnb's request to refund our reservation. I was left with a disappointing taste. 
3969526,20844813,2014-10-06,13957944,Jurriën,"Liesl's apartment is situated in a nice and quiet area of Boston, which is easily reachable by public transport. I staid in the apartment for a couple of days when I was in Boston for a conference and shared the apartment with a colleague. Due to the double bedroom, the apartment was well suited for this. The apartment itself was perfectly clean when we arrived and the bowl of fruit in the fridge was a nice surprise. We felt right at home. Next time I'm visiting Boston I will strongly consider staying there again. "
3969526,20981597,2014-10-08,21654564,Adri,"Liesl was great.  We made arrangements the same day, and everything went smoothly.  She was helpful, easy to get a hold of, and very responsive.  The apartment was beautiful, super clean, comfortable, and quiet.  "
3969526,21343367,2014-10-15,20743812,Brian,"Great city. Great location. Great apartment. Great hosts. Had minor problem with wifi. Stephan was round and fixed it in 15 minutes. Out front door turn right.  50 m turn left on Harrison. 500 m to Estragon spanish restaurant on rhs.
Out front door. Left to Washington.  Mikes Diner 50m. All that is good in America. Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum is stunning. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps ct4 bus on Harrison."
3969526,21438147,2014-10-17,22067948,Ava,Liesl is very warm and welcoming host. And her apartment is very clean and nice too. Definitely will suggest my friend if they visit Boston next time.   
3969526,21594136,2014-10-20,21012449,Tyler,"A beautiful, extremely well maintained apartment, on a beautiful street with anything you could want easily accessible."
3969526,22115741,2014-10-30,19179725,Gail,"Liesl was welcoming, informative and had the flat very well organised when we arrived.
The flat is spacious, clean and cozy with all the necessity needed for our short stay. 
The location is fairly convenient to get to the city and the neighborhood is quaint with red bricks and tress around. 
Overall, we had a great time and stay in Boston. "
3969526,22372704,2014-11-04,22157771,Heather And Jessee,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our extended weekend visit to Boston at this beautiful, spacious, clean, and safe location. The pictures posted here are very true to reality. Our purpose was sightseeing, visiting friends and experiencing Boston culture. We were easily able to access public transportation and enjoyed clear communication with Liesl. I would choose this location again, especially to enjoy more of her granola! "
3969526,22487212,2014-11-08,7127885,Francesco,"   The hostess and her husband were very welcoming without overstepping any bounds. One minor problem was rectified within a few hours. We particularly enjoyed her welcome Granola. 

The appartment is in pristine condition as it was recently renovated. The sheets and towels were spakling white and fluffy. 

  Transportation (SL4 and SL5 buses ) into central Boston were just around the corner. Several days we walked to the Museum of Fine Arts, Isabell Stewart Gardiner museum, Boston Symphony Hall and the Boston Public Library.

     Worcester Sqaure has a great deal of charm with it's private park and Statue. Southend Vistorain house and gardens were a great visual pleasure.
"
3969526,22812656,2014-11-15,1226895,Christian,"I reserved Liesl's terrific space for a colleague's week-long business trip. He found the apartment to be large, warm, and exactly as described, and Liesl's homemade granola to be ""fabulous."" The apartment's accessibility to public transportation was much appreciated, as were Liesl's attention to detail and responsiveness. We won't hesitate to book with Liesl again."
3969526,22892793,2014-11-17,22062531,Trina,I love Liesl's attention to detail. We were welcomed with fresh fruit and granola along with chocolates on our pillows. The unit location was perfect and extremely comfortable as well as immaculate- a true home away from home! I highly recommend this listing. 
3969526,23040922,2014-11-21,17094902,Helen,"This was my first visit to Boston and unfamiliar with nice areas to stay, I could see from the pictures  that not only the apartment but the area was of a high standard and a safe place to b located. The apartment was exactly as described and shown in the photos and perfect for our stay.  I would easily stay at this apartment again should I be back in the area and recommend to friends. Thanks Liesl for your help. "
3969526,23108714,2014-11-23,22964085,Chad,"Great, quiet location. Apartment is well maintained, clean, very functional and quite charming. "

3969526,23611397,2014-12-06,6307208,Jason,"Liesl is great, and we had a great stay. If you have meetings in Back Bay this place, combined with Uber or your feet, is super convenient! 
"
3969526,24148622,2014-12-21,24127750,Mike,"A fantastic experience from start to finish. Liesl's description of the apartment and neighborhood are spot-on. A beautiful, historic neighborhood close to the downtown/back bay and the apartment itself could not be more welcoming, well-appointed, or spotless. 
Upon arriving, the only issue we found was that the fridge was not on, which was a breaker issue. Liesl responded in a timely manner and stopped by the next day while we were out to fix it. 
Other than that, it should be noted that the neighborhood is not especially ""car-friendly"". You'll need to use inconvenient metered parking on adjacent blocks or find a garage (none of which are particularly near). 
Trifling detail, because we had a beautiful experience. Thanks, Liesl!"
3969526,24535368,2014-12-30,10198244,Garrett,"Liesl, 
Thank you for for letting us stay in your home.  It worked out well for what we needed and was centrally located.  The house was clean and well maintained and had everything that we needed.  We would stay there again if if you would have us.  "
3969526,24903219,2015-01-03,16254625,Lauren,"Located in the historic & charming South End, Liesl's apt. was perfect for 4 of us to feel at home in between siteseeing jaunts. The apt. was spacious, the beds comfortable, the place clean, the neighborhood perfect. Definitely recommended. "
3969526,25365324,2015-01-13,7935915,New,Liesl's home is a great little hideaway and was perfect for my brief winter excursion in the South End!
3969526,25636257,2015-01-21,25155989,Samantha,"We had the most amazing time in this beautiful apartment in Boston! Leisl is such a wonderful host and thought of everything within the apartment...including her delicious homemade granola! If you are looking for a warm, inviting and comfortable apartment, you won't be disappointed with Leisl's beautiful apartment. Thank you for a great experience Leisl :) Sam, Australia "
3969526,25769610,2015-01-25,5808027,Julia,"Liesl was the best Airbnb host I have had to date (she is probably my 10th host). Her apartment is gorgeous and great location - parking being the only issue, but this is Boston's (or city's in general) and not Liesl's problem. She was responsive and helpful. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
3969526,26681797,2015-02-17,24363296,Ramone,"I had a wonderful stay at Liesl's apartment. The apartment was as described. Cozy, centrally located and filled with every appliance one would need for a weekend stay or even weeks. The  apartment is beautiful. I was there on work--during the 3 week blizzard and I couldn't have asked for better accommodations. Individual heating/air systems in each room, washer and dryer, comfortable beds. It was a wonderful visit despite the weather conditions.

Public transportation was only about a 5 minute walk away and got you to every main attraction the city has to offer with great ease. The neighborhood is safe and with tons of restaurants, shops and grocery stores along the main avenue nearby. 

At one point the internet went out, Liesl and her husband were VERY responsive and within 24 hours it was all taken care of. I highly recommend. And would return if I had the opportunity.

Liesl did stop by twice without notice--and at one point let herself in which I found a little invasive, but nonetheless she was friendly. 

Please don't pass up this opportunity. The south end is beautiful and the apartment GORGEOUS. "
3969526,27052396,2015-02-24,4259883,Libby,"We came to Boston while the city was struggling with 90"" of snow, so we were grateful for the cozy, well-located apartment on a quiet street. We spent more time indoors than a summertime visitor might, so we had a chance to enjoy the comfy couch, interesting book collection and convenient kitchen. Decor is very attractive. We appreciated the ample closet space in the bedrooms. Would love to return when the sidewalks aren't so icy so we could explore the neighborhood!"
3969526,27644333,2015-03-09,25805637,Chris,"The apartment was amazing!  Very cozy and upscale.  It was a very comfortable week.

The little things really made it special:
-Memory Foam Mattresses
-Washer/Dryer in the apartment
-Very upscale kitchen
-Close to the T

Liesl even left me some delicious granola!  Highly recommended if you're looking for a special place to spend some time in Boston"
3969526,27821523,2015-03-12,17344603,Asher,"The house was beautiful, and Liesl went out of her way to accommodate our last minute trip. I'd be very happy to stay here again."
3969526,27993710,2015-03-16,21323923,Miriam,"I can only recommend Liesl and her apartment. Everything was as described, contact to her was easy and fast. Access to public transport and therefore to all areas of the city is very close by and easy to understand. Neighborhood is very nice and quiet. The apartment is exactly as it looks like on the pictures and equipped with all essentials. Light in the living room is a bit dark, but as we anyway spent most time in the city, we did not really mind. I would definitely one back."
3969526,28149156,2015-03-18,11272077,Daniel,Apartment was as described.  Great service.  We'd recommend the apartment to anyone.
3969526,28273307,2015-03-21,3736604,Megan,"Leisl was an incredible host. Before we even got there she was great about connecting with me to make sure we'd be able to get in easily and safely, which we did. When we got into the apartment, we saw there were tons of notes around the house explaining how to use things, etc, which was extremely helpful and made us feel at home."
3969526,28517074,2015-03-25,26579456,Sebastian,"El lugar es fantástico, tranquilo y con buena conectividad. El departamento está muy bien cuidado, preparado para recibir a cuatro personas, con una agradable concina con todo lo necesario para pasar un buen rato. Las habitaciones son espaciosas, y bastante cómodas. No dudaría en recomendarlo."
3969526,28667160,2015-03-28,10946547,Andre,"We spent two nights at Liesl's two-bedroom in the South End and it was a perfect experience. The apartment is absolutely immaculate, has a well stocked kitchen, and two luminous bedrooms. The building is on  an exquisite South End ""square"" of bow front brick buildings in an area filled with excellent neighborhoods.  

The host, Liesl, is very responsive, checked in on us to see that everything was up to par, and was kind enough to offer to mail us a phone charger that we left behind. She also provided us with a goody bag of ""South End"" granola and fruit upon arrival, which was very much appreciated--along with a late check out.

The apartment is about a ten minute walk to the Mass Avenue T stop and very convenient to most areas of Boston. It is a great choice when visiting Boston.
"
3969526,28927598,2015-04-01,1582502,Eamon,"Stress free and professional check-in even though we arrived late in the evening. The apartment looks just as it does in the photos and the location is great for getting into the centre of town. Perfect for a long weekend and we would have been happy to stay much longer. 
Would definitely stay again."
3969526,29503302,2015-04-08,25851071,Yuxuan,"在波士顿非常好的民宿,位置很好找,屋子里面非常干净,装修考究,Lisel非常贴心,还给女儿准备了玩具,是家庭出行波士顿的很好选择。停车非常方便,路边就可以,周日全天免费,平常夜间也是免费的,对于停车费昂贵的波士顿来说非常重要。总是是一次完美的体验。"
3969526,29824414,2015-04-13,404491,Julie,"Our stay at Liesl's apartment was simply great. The Silver line is less than a block away, it makes it really easy to get to downtown. Newburry street is a 10-15 min walk. All the essentials are provided. The place is spotless. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat. "
3969526,30011804,2015-04-16,22115236,Russell,"Liesl is a very welcoming host.  She had the apartment clean and ready for us by the check-in time.  Liesl was very helpful with advice on the area and made contact throught our stay to make sure we were alright.

The apartment is in the South End part of town.  There are a few restaurants and grocery stores in the neighbourhood, however there is very little to peak a travellers interest within 15 minutes walk.  There is a bus stop 30 seconds walk away.

In the lower level of an old Brownstone building, the apartment was lovely and modern looking inside.  We had all the amenities we needed - kitchenwares, towels, extra blankets, large washing machine and clothes dryer.  Heating was good throughout.  There was very basic cable on tv, however there was a Roku box with HBO Go and Netflix etc.

The apartment was 2 bedrooms with queen beds, a bathroom, laundry, kitchen and living area.  It was large enough for our family of 4.

If you are looking for somewhere quiet to stay just outside of the downtown area I would recommend Liesl and her apartment."
3969526,30141806,2015-04-18,29264333,Cathy,"The apartment was just as pictured. Very nice, clean and comfortable. Beds very comfortable. 
We did not have any coffee or tea there, but noticed they and some granola were left for us. It was very thoughtful. Maybe if a small carton of milk were there, we may have indulged. There are shops nearby. We just didn't bother.
Liesel is quick to answer questions and is very helpful. We would book there again."
3969526,30752180,2015-04-27,18473302,Peter,"Perfect experience, exactly as described. Liesls apartment is very convenient. It's a quick ride on the silver bus line to reach downtown, there are incredible places to eat within walking distance.  Liesl is very accommodating, always checking in to make sure we had everything needed. It was a great experience all around, would definitely stay here again. "
3969526,31123232,2015-05-02,14058914,Stephanie,"This is a fantastic South End location near all of the amazing restaurants and bars the neighborhood has to offer. The place itself is clean, updated, comfortable, and well kept. Check in and check out were very simple. Liesl was responsive and communicative leading up to and throughout our stay. This was overall another wonderful Air B&B experience!  "
3969526,31425488,2015-05-05,26740672,Joan,"The apartment was exactly as described. It was spotlessly clean and we felt at home immediately. Beds very comfortable. The location is excellent for touring Boston-just an agreeable walk from many Boston highlights.

Liesl was very attentive and her home made granola was amazing."
3969526,31866504,2015-05-11,7534402,Kelsey,"Liesl was a wonderful host! I booked this apartment for my parents who were in town for the weekend. The entire process was very efficient and organized. The apartment was beautiful, clean, and spacious. Most importantly, the apartment is in a great area with some of the best restaurants in Boston located just a few blocks away. "
3969526,32164787,2015-05-15,28707088,Jolene,This IS a sensational South End apartment.  High quality and clean. There are good restaurants all around was very pleased to find Equator (Thai) at 1721 Washington St.  The beds are so comfortable and the linens are towels were also of high quality.  A basket of fruit and gluten free granola was waiting for us when we arrived (being GF this was a much appreciated extra for me).   We were very happy that we did not have to make use of the umbrella's provided - the weather was perfect  
3969526,32446359,2015-05-18,24776602,Meg,The host made us feel very welcome and important.  She checked in with us more than once to be sure everything was o.k.  The place was exactly like it was listed.  Perfect for us.  The neighborhood was charming South End Boston with historic brownstones.
3969526,32672636,2015-05-20,25847149,Kimberly,"Notes were left detailing important aspects of the rental. Host was responsive to my inquiries.
"
3969526,32933610,2015-05-23,3807422,Loren,"We came to the beautiful South End and came to the perfect apt to stay in. Close to shops and tasty restaurants, it was perfect. Easy to grab keys and Liesl was always prompt on her responses. Thanks!"
3969526,33073345,2015-05-25,27834412,Lynn,"We were very pleased with our stay.  This apartment is clean, easy to locate and the perfect size for 2-4 people.  We found the neighborhood fun, eclectic and safe.  The apartment is well furnished and organized.  We loved the fresh fruit, granola, tea and coffee.  There are shops, restaurants and 711 very close by for convenience.  We parked at the hospital and it was safe and very reasonable for the weekend.  The host's were quick to get back to us with questions and small issues we had.  We even got a visit to fix our WIFI, which was still an issue, but they tried to fix it and we appreciated that.  We would stay here again and will recommend it to friends."
3969526,33643766,2015-05-31,24969695,Mark,"The apartment is well located, large and very clean. Liesl has included lots of extras to make the place feel as comfortable as a great hotel. Soft towels, home made muesli, tea selection etc all greatly appreciated. Some brilliant restaurants in the area and Liesl has plenty of recommendations (Yes, the Fish Taco's at Picco really are awesome!). I will certainly try here first the next time I'm passing through Boston. "
3969526,34060954,2015-06-04,30681214,Neil,"Great location, an easy 30 minute walk to downtown, but transport good too. Plenty of bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk. A very comfortable apartment, spotlessly clean and a real home from home. Liesl was a great host, very attentive and quick to respond to enquiries. Would recommend without hesitation. "
3969526,34515386,2015-06-09,548443,Bart,"The apartment offered enough space fir the two of us, but would also do for a party of 4. Everything was clean, excellent beds, kitchen well equiped. Because of being on the ground floor, the apartment feels a bit dark. We enjoyed the neighbourhood; quiet and nice restaurants. The only remark might be the limited availability of TV channels. "
3969526,34935124,2015-06-14,27797521,Julie,"The host left welcoming notes, chocolate on the pillow cases, and e-mailed to check to see how things were going.  She made us feel very welcome.

The neighborhood was safe and clean.  It had a little park right across the street.  

We liked that the Silver Line bus to downtown Boston was at the end of the block.  Very nice after a long day of sight seeing.  We didn't have to walk far to get to the apartment."
3969526,36504106,2015-06-29,22876289,Dan,"Liesl is so good host,we are so happy our stay there!"
3969526,44148957,2015-08-24,9154855,Julie,The place was fantastic. Great location as well. We walked all around the area and really enjoyed it. The apartment itself was very nice inside with all the necessary amenities. Great place to stay.
3969526,45553556,2015-09-04,31250543,双,"Liesl是特别负责任的房东,入住期间还发信息问房子合不合意,有没有需要。房子位置很好,离Boston Medical Center只要三分钟步行,离繁华的Back Bay也很近,可以步行或者公交到达。房子里设施齐全,非常干净。"

3969526,46572901,2015-09-12,9385796,Charles,"The apartment was exactly what we needed for our trip to Boston. The rooms were big enough to make it feel like home,  the kitchen was great,  and being able to do our laundry,  iron our clothes,  and relax between conference outings made it a steal at the price. 

The only downsides were a weak wifi connection and the daily construction every morning at 8am, but the latter I'm sure is just part of living in the city. 

Thanks Liesel for all your help while we were there."
3969526,47177194,2015-09-16,3188999,David,"You can't oversell this Sensational South End two bedroom apartment. It is ideally located in one of the hippest parts of town. Walking distance to bars, restaurants, cafes, transportation, conveniences and downtown even! The apartment is modern, clean and very comfortable and Liesl was very responsive, friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended!"
3969526,47457395,2015-09-19,5153041,Sally,"Arriving in South End, Boston, we were unsure about the area. At first it appears pretty seedy, but turn into Worcester Sq, and see the lovely garden down the middle of the street and the historic brownstones, and hope is restored. The apartment was quiet and comfortable, with 2 bedrooms, the bed in the blue room was good memory foam mattress. Wifi was good, washer and dryer, kitchen had what you need, you just have to find supplies. Good luck at the local 711, best to grab an uber and go a few blocks away. Liesl offered restaurant ideas and we went to Toro just around the corner, twice. It was that good.
We found the apartment to be  a welcome oasis from the heat and noise of the city. Thanks again Liesl."
3969526,47606994,2015-09-21,6665138,McKenzie,Our weekend spent at Liesl's beautiful apartment went off without a hitch. Liesl was simply fantastic to work with and was so accommodating. The apartment is located on a peaceful street in a charming neighborhood and the inside of the listing is as pristine as the photos. I would highly recommend this apartment and hope to re-visit it one day myself.

We love the MFA and Fenway park.  Everything we needed was provided and we were comfortable in the blue room.  We had a great time thank you."
3969526,49020005,2015-09-30,27431886,Claire,"Very nice spacious apartment in a great location in the South End. Quick transit into Downtown with the Silverline buses, stop at end of square. We walked it in 45 minutes, at a leisurely pace.

It was very comfortable and Liesl even added some lovely touches like providing fruit, her own granola mix and lovely fresh flowers. Liesl was always on hand to answer any questions we had - she was a great host.  The apartment was very close to the silver line bus stop which made it very easy to get into the city. I highly recommend Liesl's apartment."

3969526,52487915,2015-10-30,42953266,Morgan,"Liesl's condo was the perfect location in the South end, conveniently located one block from the silver line bus stop. The beds were very comfortable, house was clean and orderly. Liesl was very responsive to any questions on transportation and nearby restaurant/market recommendations. We traveled with a baby, so the convenience of the street level access was a huge bonus. Easily walkable to nearby coffee shops. We enjoyed our stay and would try to stay there again if we ever make it back to Boston!"

Schönes kleines Badezimmer. Tolle Lage und super Nachbarschaft.
Leider haben wir Liesl nicht persönlich kennengelernt
Sehr zu empfehlen, Liesl war jederzeit erreichbar und hat uns wertvolle Tipps gegeben"

Neighborhood is quiet lovely with minimal traffic and noise outside, providing quite the relaxing space. Liesl was amazing to work with. Any questions or concerns we had she responded to right away. We will definitely look this apartment up next time we come to Boston."

3969526,58134714,2016-01-01,9781942,Carol And Steve,"Liesl is your consulate host! She was a great communicator as we made our way through the reservation process, she went above and beyond her call of duty in shopping for me so that we would have some grocery items in the fridge since we arrived to Boston on Christmas Eve and things would be closed on Christmas. 
The apartment lives up to it's name and is truly sensational. She had left us her 'homemade' granola...delicious and appreciated!
I loved that she had left so many touches that I enjoy;clean and comfortable is always at the top of my list and her apt was both, beautiful white towels, the master bedroom had a very comfortable tempur-pedic mattress and great storage in both bedrooms, each room had a luggage rack which I love and unbelievably so many hosts don't include in their guests rooms. The apt had a W/D which is always a godsend when you accidentally spill something on your favorite shirt or whatever your need for it might be, having that is a true plus for a week long stay. Liesl has truly made her apt feel like a home away from home. "
3969526,61565364,2016-02-06,53058911,Bing,Liesl was a perfect host.  Her home is beautiful and comfortable.  I would recommend her place in Boston to any and all of my friends and family.
3969526,67404689,2016-03-29,53452159,Carl,Lovely apartment in a great location to explore Boston. Liesl is extremely helpful and responsive to questions. This was the first time we have used Airbnb and we were delighted with this experience.
3969526,68278567,2016-04-04,29113928,Andrea,"Liesl's apartment is clean, lovely and comfortable and she supplies almost everything you need for a ""home away from home"" feel.  She was very responsive to a couple of issues I had and resolved them quickly. I would definitely return if I find myself in Boston again."
3969526,69481994,2016-04-11,62042755,Tom,"Liesl and the apartment were both great. The place was very nice and clean, no problems at all. Liesl was very friendly and quick to answer any questions and help out any way she could. Thanks, Liesl!"
3969526,70050871,2016-04-15,45347064,Jill,"Had a great time in Boston, the apartment was immaculate and very comfortable for our group of three adults.  Liesl was very quick to respond to messages, kept in touch for the whole trip and gave us some really useful information on local amenities and transportation.  The key to the porch door was tricky at times but Liesl responded immediately and was arranging for this to be fixed. The neighbourhood was quiet and it was very easy to get into town by bus.  Thank you Liesl for your hospitality and I certainly would recommend your apartment to friends and family. 

"
3969526,70596538,2016-04-18,51603371,Lauren,"Liesl, was a great host and very responsive. The place is as described and the neighborhood was very pretty.  Only issue was that the front door keys really did not work and were a major hassle. Once we were in the place was great. "
3969526,71299981,2016-04-24,27124708,Kyle,"Perfect location for a long weekend in Boston. Home was clean, and just like in the pictures. Liesl was super accommodating as well. Would recommend to anyone planning a trip to Boston."

3969526,72264735,2016-05-01,33822851,Mercedes,"We had the best time at this apartment! It was beautiful, very comfortable and Liesl was super accommodating and communicated very well. She gave us tons of information about Boston and the neighborhood we were staying in. The only minor thing was that the foyer door stuck, and we had some issues when we had to unlock it, but other than that it was PERFECT!"
3969526,74055650,2016-05-12,31607506,Stanislav,"Nice stay for 10 days in May'2016. Liesl supported us with everything, helped to organize a baby crib for 1.5 years old daughter. It wasn't easy to open the door at arrival. Liesl came in 20 minutes and fixed it. "
3969526,75102375,2016-05-18,16404624,Jennifer,We recently  spent 5 days in Liesl's lovely apartment. It was very clean and well furnished. The photos  on Airbnb  are just how it is. The beds are extremely  comfortable! The apartment  is in a quiet street with the local bus a 5 minute walk away at the end of the street. The bus runs every 15 minutes and is a short ride into town. All communication  with  Liesl was easy and she replied promptly. The apartment was quite  comfortable  for 4 adults. I would definitely  recommend  staying here. Thanks Liesl.
3969526,77504828,2016-06-01,39629181,Julie,Our stay at 29 Worcester was amazing.  The brownstone on street level in the beautiful neighborhood was beyond our expectations.  We loved exploring the Southend with so many restaurants and parks in walking distance.  The two bedrooms were spacious with lots of storage space.  I especially enjoyed the unique touches by our host to make us feel comfortable.  All the amenities were provided including a full size washer/dryer.
3969526,77760923,2016-06-03,62829026,Rebecca,"Absolutely beautiful apt in the south end.  Perfect size, comfortable living room/sitting area, lots of storage for clothing in the bedrooms, and the beds were very comfortable.  
A few small (URL HIDDEN) A/C in the bedrooms and the lock to the entrance was very hard to use.  The lock should be fixed or there should be set instructions upon renting on how to use.  Liesl was very responsive and great to rent from. 

"
3969526,78566577,2016-06-07,19697114,Danielle,"This listing was excellent! The location was perfect, with lots of restaurant's, bar's, grocery stores, etc. within a 10 min walk.

Die Lage der Wohnung ist hervorragend in einer sehr ruhigen Nachbarschaft.
Etwas störend war der gelegentliche Fluglärm in den Morgenstunden."
3969526,81414207,2016-06-22,22908282,Dawn,"Home and Area: This place was beyond amazing.  Absolutely the nicest and cleanest Airbnb in which I've stayed.  It was a quiet sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Boston.  The home was well-appointed and had everything we could possibly need (the mark of an excellent host).  The apartment is large and you really don't feel like you're in the city.  The bedrooms are a very good size, there's lots of closet space and the beds and pillows are SO comfortable.  The neighborhood has restaurants and shops within a short walk, however Uber is a short and cheap call away if you'd like to get more into the city.

I'd like to address a couple of things that I've read in reviews: the lock on the foyer door - not a problem at all.  Liesl gives instruction on how to open it with ease.  We never found this an issue.  Don't let it stray you.  No central air - also, not a problem.  It got up to 92 degrees while in Boston and the units in the bedrooms kept things quite comfortable.  I'm typically hot natured and was very cool in the apartment.  So, don't let that stray you either.  

Host: Liesl was wonderful.  She was responsive, kind, had easy communication and took the time to think of the details.  She worked with us in the check-in process due to some flight issues and was very accommodating.  And while we never met her, I can't say enough how much we enjoyed and appreciated this Airbnb experience.   If ever in Boston, this would be my go-to location.  Simply wonderful in every way!"
3969526,82383143,2016-06-27,59312533,Nathan,"This place was a great place to stay! Liesl made everything about staying there easy, comfortable, and convenient. It's in a nice, quiet neighborhood but still close to all the great parts of Boston"
3969526,82997946,2016-06-30,4927871,Elizabeth,"The apartment is in a lovely area, the apartment is very clean and arrival arrangements and communications with Liesl were excellent.  "
3969526,83418655,2016-07-02,80053649,Moon,Liesl was always there when I need her and the place was stunning. I would visit again.
3969526,84136198,2016-07-05,30939097,Chris,"Liesl was an amazing host and the home was incredible! The unit itself was beautifully appointed - great kitchen, cozy living room, nice bedrooms and bathroom. The neighborhood was quiet, but we never felt too far away from great restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc. My wife and I shared the condo with another couple we were traveling with and never felt cramped. We couldn't ask for more from an Airbnb at this price point. We would without hesitation stay here again and have already recommended it to friends. "
3969526,84708943,2016-07-08,66705966,Katherine,The building and neighborhood looked just as it did in the photo.  Lovely.  Liesl is super responsive if you have questions.  This apt. in particular was quiet and cozy.  A perfect place to stay in Boston.
3969526,85722342,2016-07-12,6816584,Susan,"My family and I had such a wonderful stay at Liesl's home.  The house was beautifully appointed, location ideal and Liesl a thoughtful host.  Our 5 year old daughter especially appreciated the books and toys that were in the house.  Also, the bed in the master bedroom was so comfortable!  Thanks again for everything Liesl! "
3969526,88273855,2016-07-23,36992193,Darren,"Liesl was absolutely amazing. We arrived early into Boston and she was able to accommodate us and allow us into the house.

The place was immaculate and in a perfect area for our travels. Boston is a walking city and this house was easily walk able from all over.

Liesl gave us suggestions on where to buy groceries from, to eat and to park our rental car for the 2 days we had one. (Valet parking at the hospital at the end of the (URL HIDDEN) perfect.)

The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. At one point, there was a little band playing in the little park on the weekend. So charming.

We were there during a heatwave and the AC in both bedrooms kept us very cool at night after a long day of sightseeing.

Highly recommend Liesl's place as your base in Boston. I loved the fact that i could retire early if I wanted to and the other people in my party could stay up and watch TV (can't do that in hotels)
"
3969526,89117898,2016-07-26,54779367,Anja,"Me and my family (2 teenagers) had a perfect stay in Liesl's appartment at Worcester square, both just as nice as in the pictures. It was clean, perfect beds and kitchen. We walked to town once and took the bus once (stops around the corner and delivers you Downtown for 2 dollars) and enjoyed Boston. Toro and Teranga are both very nice restaurants also around the corner. In two words ' very recommendable' if you want to visit Boston. "
3969526,90878215,2016-08-02,63756897,Pierre,Lovely place to stay. Lots of restaurants and bars around. Museum a few bus stations away.
3969526,93086851,2016-08-11,45680868,Megan,We found Leisl's place to be a great location! Everything was very clean and as pictured on the Airbnb site. Would highly recommend. Only downside to our visit was that we couldn't get the tv to work. It was during the Olympics so was a bit disappointing that we couldn't catch much action when we were in the apartment. 
3969526,93898913,2016-08-14,1632624,Sergey,"Wonderful apartment in a residential area of Boston close to Boston Medical center. The apartment is very clean and quiet. We had a car but always managed to find street parking within two blocks from the apartment (street parking is free between 6 pm and 8 am). When we had questions, Liesl immediately responded to us. Highly recommend!  "
3969526,95734945,2016-08-20,29291220,Sarah,Liesl was great before and during our stay. She was very responsive when the tv stopped working and when we needed the find the breaker panel. We met she and her family and they were lovely and very helpful. Cozy spot to stay and close to what we needed in Boston!
3969526,96600855,2016-08-23,43252905,Jonathan,"Amazing location, clean apartment and well furnished. Felt like home, thank you for your hospitality. "
3969526,98939347,2016-09-02,68223471,Lester,"Liesl's apartment is very nice.  South End is one of the best neighborhood's in Boston.  It's conveniently located but still quiet and peaceful.  The apartment was clean and well stocked with everything we needed during our stay.  I was travelling with my 90 year old mother so the feature I liked most was that there are no stairs to enter the apartment.  Our last night there, there was a free concert in the square on the block.  Liesl made sure we knew about it and provided a lawn chair for us.  A very attentive host who made sure we we settled in and then left us alone.  Perfect.  I give Liesl 5 stars and highly recommend her and her apartment."
3969526,100159326,2016-09-07,58837827,Charlotte,"What an outstanding hostess and prime location. I have no doubt it's hard to find this gem with availabilities. So far a favorite Airbnb experience.  

The hospitality exceeded my expectations. Little touches like being greeted with accurate instructions, homemade granola and a kitchen with ample basics to make food. There was a fresh bar of soap in the shower displayed in a quaint way, hangers in the ample closet/storage area. 

I am so glad we didn't stay in a hotel, what we experienced here was what it feels like to be a local. I was so relaxed while I was there.

The location was outstanding, quaint and close to great restaurants, convenience shops and all you could want in the South End. I was amazed at how quiet it was and how safe I felt. The small space had clearly been designed with class and Feng Shui in mind and designed to be maintained with cleanliness in mind.

3969526,101696347,2016-09-14,89570265,Marnee,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was an outstanding one. Liesl's place was spotless, well-equipped and very roomy.  The neighborhood was quiet, safe and walkable. Liesl answered questions and emails promptly. She even left some yummy granola for my yogurt! If you are visiting Boston, this is the perfect home away from home."
3969526,102974989,2016-09-19,68715211,Pedram,"Liesl was a wonderful host. Unfortunately, the communications were really early in the morning and we were still on CA time. 

My only compliant was that our flight wasn't until 6:30 pm and the check out time was 11 AM. I understand the need to get the apt ready for the next guest however, it would have been great if we could have stayed at least until 2-2:30 instead of hanging out at the airport for 7 hours.  "
3969526,103105296,2016-09-20,94271897,Aleshka,Very kind and friendly communication.  Beautifulky clean home.  Easy to access and a very safe neighborhood!  Wish we could have stayed longer!  Next trip to Boston we will try to stay with Liesl again.

3969526,107804571,2016-10-12,97004936,Nathan,"This was a beautiful 2 bedroom. Centrally located to get around town easily. Public parking around the corner at a pay lot was a breeze. 
The hosts instruction were very clear and getting in and out was easy. Beds were very comfortable and the building is quiet. Highly recommend walking around the corner to Blunch for a great panini. "

3969526,129170485,2017-01-29,85848754,Steve,"A great basement apartment for a nice stay in Boston's South End. Parking is an issue but with Boston you know that going in.

3969526,145488849,2017-04-18,10485979,Len,"We stayed here when I ran in the Boston Marathon. It was a great location, not just for that but for restaurants, public transportation, and night life (which I didn't get to participate in).  

It's exactly as portrayed in the photos.  Great kitchen and living area.  Excellent mattress, which I really appreciated and cool neighborhood.  I would definitely stay here again."

3969526,149119151,2017-05-02,35480246,Lee,"Liesl's place is beautiful - she has thought of every detail for guest comfort and ease. The apartment is spacious, light and lovely, in a good location - easy to walk to bus line, get a taxi or uber, etc. It is a quiet neighborhood, off of a main street, with local foot traffic, but not a lot of street noise.
The restaurants in the neighborhood are really good, (Thai, Senegalese, a diner, and some great bakery/cafe's). ""Foodies, "" a nice food market is only a 7-minute walk away. We went out for meals, but also cooked in the lovely kitchen. Great for a couple or a family."
3969526,150285623,2017-05-07,1349272,Cynthia,Liesl was very attentive. We took a red-eye so she allowed us to check in when the flat was ready. Also supplied extra plates for a dinner party. The place is exactly as it reads and photographs and a real find! 
3969526,151173197,2017-05-11,70715879,Doug,Great two bedroom in South End Boston. Walking distance to Back Bay and very accessible to downtown. Liesl is a great host that replies quickly. My co-worker and I shared this airbnb for 4 days and would stay again if we were back in town.
3969526,152489902,2017-05-16,16526411,Mary Liz,"Lovely apartment, comfy and roomy for my husband and me, and our 19 year old daughter.  Great location in the beautiful South End. Love seeing the great architecture and parks in the area.  Easy walk to anything you need ~ good restaurants, groceries, drugstore. Liesl is easy and quick with communication, and very accommodating! "
3969526,153937740,2017-05-22,12882795,Em,"We had a very lovely stay at your place.  It is so welcoming and tastefully appointed.  Just beautiful.  The location was perfect and we loved the pretty park across the street.  Nearby restaurants, bakery, and Dunkin' were easily accessed on foot. Liesl communicated with us prior to arrival and check on us during our stay via text. She is a perfect host.  I would happily stay many times over!"
3969526,154256476,2017-05-23,49395491,Rui,"So far, this is the worst experience I've ever had in Airbnb. 

I'm traveling with my parents. I wanted to check in early and tried to make it by communicating with the host one week earlier. The host told me to confirm with her one day earlier and I did so. Then the host said I had to confirm on the exact day. Because of a flight issue, my parents, who can hardly speak English, arrived at Boston around 11:00 before me. I wanted to make sure my parents had a place to stay in the rainy day, so I talked to Liesl if my parents could check in at 12 pm. Liesl refused. They finally checked in at 2 pm. It's understandable because sometimes hosts have strict rules. 

However, on the next day, we wanted to do the freedom trail badly but the check out time is also very strict: 11 am. we simply can't make it with heavy luggages. I expressed our passion and wished to leave our luggage at the door promising to get it back by 1 pm. This time, no surprise, Liesl refused. 

I'm not shocked by her determination but the reason she gave us: the guests were arriving by 11am. Are u kidding me? U didn't allow us to check in by 11 am but allowed others? I even communicated one week before! I was so angry and disappointed. Airbnb shouldn't be a place that people well behaved are treated differently. 

Moreover, if the next guests were checking in at 11 am and we were checking out at the same time, where did u put the $80 cleansing fee? 

I'm so sorry that I made my parents waiting for 2 hours in the rain while they flied such long distance to my graduation ceremony."
3969526,156431470,2017-05-30,12901121,Louise,"A wonderful apartment in a great area of Boston. We enjoyed the decoration, the comfortable beds and homely feel of the place. Everything is very clean as well. We enjoyed popping down the road to the local diner which was tasty on a few mornings. Liesl replied very quickly to any queries we had and was great at communicating. "
3969526,157132693,2017-06-02,24579365,Hayley,"Overall, a very comfortable stay at Liesl's place. A minor note to families with babies: you'll pay extra for a pack and play."
3969526,157580184,2017-06-04,37974469,Stacy,"We had the best time on our girls weekend!! The apartment is beautiful, beds so comfy, so clean, so bright...just perfection! I'll never stay in a hotel in Boston again...this will be my go to place!"
3969526,159559178,2017-06-11,46339675,Sally,Description of apartment very accurate.  Good location for bus line and a bit away from the noise of downtown.  Apartment very clean and accommodating.  I would definitely stay here again.
3969526,160332291,2017-06-13,132082004,Cynthia,My 17 y.o. daughter and I stayed here while looking at colleges in the Boston area.  The apartment is located in a picturesque residential neighborhood w restaurants and a grocery shop in walking distance.  It was perfect for what we needed.
3969526,160769308,2017-06-15,101002062,Hanyu,"Liesl's house is very suitable for holiday. The house is clean, and  in a lovely neighborhood. Liesl helped me solve many problems during my stay. Staying in this house gives me a very good trip in Boston.
"
3969526,162109732,2017-06-19,33295591,Loveleen,"I have stayed in many airbnb's and this was one of my favorite ones.  Liesl is on top of things, her place is in a great location, perfectly maintained, very charming, wonderful amenities and the best part is she's helpful, accommodating and quick to respond.  The location was great and made my first trip to Boston even more wonderful.  So happy that I booked with Liesl!!!"
3969526,164518979,2017-06-28,22489314,Andrew,"Communication with Liesl was great, she responded extremely quickly and was very helpful.  The apartment is ok.  Being on the ground floor was perfect for my mother-in-law as there were no steps to navigate.  The downside being that as this is more of a basement apartment it's dark and unfortunately a little smelly in the communal area.  There's no aircon in the living area/kitchen and this meant even with the provided fan, this area was horribly hot. There also was no information about parking either on the description or in the house manual which was a big shame as we were ticketed on the first night."
3969526,165056397,2017-06-30,116111026,Isabelle,"The apartment was everything we needed and more for a perfect girls trip! It was absolutely spotless and so well decorated. The best part was that we could walk to nearly all the places we needed to go. Great location and even even better host! Would definitely stay again! Thank you so much, Liesl. "
3969526,166145075,2017-07-02,76589440,Jason,Liesl has a beautiful home that is located in a beautiful neighborhood. I'm very thankful that she made everything so easy :)
3969526,166802107,2017-07-04,15702211,Rong,"The house is very good, just like what the pictures are showing!
Liesl is super responsible and helpful!
One thingI noticed is there are some bugs and little insects in the house."
3969526,168276838,2017-07-09,116236422,Angela,Great place! We all loved our stay and the apartment was perfect for the 4 travelers we had.  Within just a few miles of anything and everything in Boston!
3969526,171724208,2017-07-18,29425807,Raquel,"The apartment was great with big and confortable rooms, clean and well equipped. The little square where it is located is charming and it is walking distance (about 20 min) from the city center. There are also cafes, and little shops around so this is very useful. Overall I would recommend this apartment!.
Thank you Liesl."
3969526,172052494,2017-07-19,83967943,Maureen,"Wonderful communication from initial inquiry to check out.   Highly recommend this lovely, well-appointed home.   It was a very warm day in Boston, so the AC's in both bedrooms was a blessing.   

Can't wait to stay here in our ne t trip to Boston!"
3969526,173064600,2017-07-22,116866416,Carolyn,"We LOVE this place.  Liesl is an incredible host.  We used the apartment as a central hub to explore Cambridge, Beacon Hill, Fenway, Central Boston and North End.  We used Uber a lot.  No ride was more than 5-10 minutes from this location.

The neighborhood is gorgeous row housing.  Each floor of a row house is an apartment.  Both sides of this quiet side street are lined with houses.  A garden area and fountain separate the two sides of the street.  The size of the apartment is huge for cities like Boston, New York or San Francisco, but small for most other parts of the country.  The two bedrooms sleep four people comfortably.  Five would be pushing it with someone on the couch or on the floor.

While the side street where the row houses sit is quiet, the main street on one end has lots of restaurants and shops.  Every morning we were able to walk to different places for breakfast.  One night we walked to a take out pizza and picked up a bottle of wine at another store.  A convenience store for odds and ends was nearby.  Liesl sent us an e-mail of suggested places to eat which we used.

Great location, great host, nice place.  Five stars for me!"
3969526,175727393,2017-07-29,30714065,Chiara,L'appartamento di Liesl è molto accogliente e confortevole
3969526,178057098,2017-08-04,72399748,Dave,"This place was wonderful, quite and charming, but within walking distance to plenty. Having stayed at several places in Boston when I come to visit I can say the value and location of this lovely home can't be beat! Our host was readily available if needed and provided many wonderful recommendations. "
3969526,181391112,2017-08-12,38690065,Rolinda,Beautiful place! Charming neighborhood! Wonderful host!  I want to go back soon!
3969526,182016551,2017-08-13,120301860,Ran,The house is clean and comfortable. The location is nice. Love it very much
3969526,183560580,2017-08-17,81098573,Clive,This is a gem.
3969526,183951293,2017-08-18,501328,Josh,"This apartment is a fine example of what makes Airbnb a great service: a more-than-comfortable apartment, a fantastic neighborhood, and a host that goes the extra mile to make the experience that much better. This home will be on my short list for any future trips to Boston."
3969526,185003684,2017-08-20,142998408,Brette,Centrally located for easy access to many places. Liesl was very helpful in providing information about the neighborhood and places to check-out near by.
3969526,186804830,2017-08-25,9171121,Kieran,"Great accommodation, location and host. Highly recommend."
3969526,188243845,2017-08-28,3323507,Nancy,"Ah! What a restful and bright, lovely place to come home to during the days we were moving our son into Berklee and visiting our daughter in Cambridge. Liesl is a thoughtful host, and everything we could possibly need was at the ready, from a curated list of restaurants, to plenty of toiletries, to specific directions. Sumptuous linens, peaceful surroundings, and an excellent South End location that was convenient to Back Bay and Cambridge both! If you're considering, do it!"
3969526,191460651,2017-09-07,106296303,Deanne,This is a great place to stay. It is good for adults and families. Great location. Our group walked or Ubered most places. Underground transportation is also within walking and we used it too. Boston is not a large city has something to offer everyone.  Liesl is an attentive host and is available for any question you may have. But her instructions are very clear. Kitchen has been updated and is well stocked for cooking needs.
3969526,193660024,2017-09-14,83784623,Marilyn,Very comfortable 2 bedroom ground floor unit. Great location for our activities in Boston.
3969526,194019134,2017-09-15,32742023,Tod,"Liesl's lovely, quiet 2 BR apartment in the South End is on a beautiful grassy square in South Boston, walking distance from a number of restaurants, other squares, some historical spots, convenient to public transportation. Parking's available. Recommended, highly!"
3969526,194326262,2017-09-16,114222531,Michael,"Fantastic apartment in an easy to get to all location.  The apartment is clean, spacious and delightful.  I highly recommend this place and will stay here again when I'm back in the city."
3969526,195524779,2017-09-19,6319915,Jason,"Can't recommend this place enough: Quiet and comfortable, well-appointed, super-clean yet homey, not at all sterile. It's on the first floor but set back from the sidewalk so it feels private and yet not at all closed-in. The apartment is on a beautiful historic garden street that feels almost like a private enclave, and it's very close to great restaurants, coffee, shopping, etc including a convenience store open late across the street. I've been in Boston many times but this is my first stay in South End and I think it will be ""my"" neighborhood from now on. Maybe not the best if you absolutely have to be close to the T, but the Silver Line bus and Hubway bike share is right around the corner, and I never waited more than 3 minutes for an Uber.  It's a perfect launch pad for sightseeing and a great place to unwind at the end of the day, very quaint and ""old world"" with rows and rows of 19th century townhouses, brick sidewalks and lots of parks and greenery and not a lot of tourists - prime Boston. Liesl was prompt with answering questions and very friendly, offering to go way beyond to make our trip better."
3969526,198199026,2017-09-28,59508301,Bev,"This apartment was perfect for us.  We couldn't have asked for a better location.  We were able to walk all over Boston from the apartment.  However, if we wanted, the silverline was a half block away. 
The space is exactly as listed.  It was cozy, inviting and in a beautiful and quiet brownstone square.
Liesl was very helpful from the planning stage of our trip to our farewell email.  All our email enquiries were responded to very promptly.  She gave accurate instructions and directions for the apartment, wonderful advice on food stores and restaurants/bakeries, and spot-on advice on what to see and do while in Boston. 
Thank you so much Liesl for your part in making our trip to Boston the fantastic vacation it was."
3969526,198469813,2017-09-29,23792311,Kristofer,"Liesl's place was exactly as described. It was  nestled in a nice little street in the South End of Boston with plenty of small restaurants and cafes close by the apartment for those who absolutely need a morning coffee.

The apartment itself was roomy and clean and the rooms were well lit. We only stayed one night, but it was homey enough to want to stay longer. Highly recommend."
3969526,199674458,2017-10-02,14032937,Giannina,Liesl's place is clean and very nice. It is a great  size for Boston and is in a very good location to walk around.  Would definitely recommend and  stay here again.
1850260,8634929,2013-11-09,1102111,Chris,"I had a wonderful stay here! I felt warmly welcomed by Sarah and her brother, who lives here as well, and all my needs were provided for with touching kindness and care. They are lovely people; Sam even walked me to the bus/train station and stayed until I'd found the right bus for Cambridge! It's a nice neighborhood close to the heart of city and imminently walkable to and from if you're up to it, and the T and buses are pretty easy and close. My room was very private, clean, and QUIET (except for some Logan Airport action overhead in the morning). You can lock your stuff up here with no worries. They offered me meals as well, and I felt very at home and welcome in every way. 

This was the perfect overnight bed for me - affordable, comfy, close to where I needed to be, easy in and out, free parking, with great hospitality and no hassles or anything unexpected. I'd be happy to stay here again, anytime. I had a great experience."
1850260,8825038,2013-11-19,9875248,Lee,"The room was great and Sarah was a lovely host.  The room is on the third floor of the house and is very private. It was spacious, clean, had a great closet, tv and a desk. The house is a few blocks from a main bus terminal which led directly into Boston and Cambridge.  I will traveling to the area again and plan to book with Sarah each time."
1850260,8863076,2013-11-22,6856334,Katherine/Daniel,My stay at Sarah's was just what I needed the night before an interview. I received a warm and informative welcome and then was provided space to be on my own. It was a lovely home with easy parking and I sincerely enjoyed meeting Sarah and her family. 
1850260,9086730,2013-12-05,8913426,Aravind,Sarah and Sam were very nice hosts. I had no trouble staying here and it is very close to dudley bus station and public transport into south station is easy.
1850260,9235150,2013-12-15,3187659,Elspeth & James,The room was very comfortable. Sarah and her family were very welcoming and she was a great host.
1850260,9507907,2013-12-31,10587064,Yunn Jyy,We love the host so much they are really a nice family! Very welcoming and friendly. They also provided breakfast which was very convenient to us. The room is spacious and looked just like the pic. 
1850260,9751204,2014-01-07,10647255,Dongjun,"The house is clean and cozy and Sarah is so kind. Also, the house is not far from the subway station. If I go to Boston agian, I will stay there!"
1850260,9778226,2014-01-09,9494950,Amarinder,"Sarah is a great host, I had great conversations with Sarah and her brother Sam. They are a very nice family and incredibly nice hosts. They accommodated me even though I was arriving very late in the evening. As far as the room goes, it is large room with huge closet.The location is close by great food."
1850260,9841801,2014-01-13,1475034,Gilean,Sarah and her family are very nice people.  They were very helpful during my stay as I was visiting someone in the hospital and even took an interest in the situation.  I had trouble with my cellphone and they helped me find a store to get it handled.  It’s a nice room on the 3rd floor.  The floor is tile and not wall-to-wall carpet which is a plus for those with allergies.  The room looks as it is in the photograph.  
1850260,10012659,2014-01-25,8913426,Aravind,This is my second time staying at sarah's place. I had no trouble checking in and out and the room was clean and comfortable as always. 
1850260,10220620,2014-02-07,11489505,Isabel,"Ce fut un séjour très agréable, dans un quartier populaire et animé,  la maison est tout près de la ""Dudley station""  bus/tram, ce qui est un atout indéniable. Sarah est une hôtesse souriante et accueillante. La chambre est propre et pourvue de tout le confort  nécessaire, elle possède aussi une salle de bains attenante spécialement dédiée aux hôtes, j'ai apprécié la double possibilité d'être totalement indépendante et de pouvoir aussi participer à la vie de la maison. La cuisine et le salon étaient à ma disposition. Sarah a aussi un petit garçon aussi souriant qu'elle ! "
1850260,10430291,2014-02-18,11468762,Nelson,"Sarah and her family were lovely, I arrived early as my flight got changed and Sarah was able to meet me even though she needed to go to work. Location is great, walking distance to lots of great places to eat and drink and there is public transport very close. 

Room is as it looks, very comfy bed, also a nice and warm place to stay. Would definitely stay there if I go back to Boston."
1850260,10593529,2014-02-26,11769775,Ibraheem,Great host and always enjoy my satay with the family.
1850260,10643993,2014-03-01,11769775,Ibraheem,Thank you for having me stay with you and your family.  You're truly a blessing and pleasant.  Lovely home.
1850260,11477956,2014-04-04,11769775,Ibraheem,Great family to stay with. Lovely home and clean environment .
1850260,11617606,2014-04-09,12761727,Lizzy,"Sarah was nothing but fabulous. She met me with a big hug and smile, made sure I was fed and could get around the city no problem, and when I wasn't too tired we enjoyed some excellent conversation. The room was clean and comfortable just as advertised. I'd highly recommend staying with Sarah-she's just a delight."
1850260,11719049,2014-04-13,12991198,Tinco,"Staying with Sarah and her family was a lovely experience. The accommodation is nice and tidy, the location is safe and very convenient(3 mins' walk to Dubley Sta., and well connected to transfer points from airport). Above all, Sarah is a very caring and inspiring lady, and her family shares such feature. I even had a chance learning African gumbo soup and tasted it with Sarah. The  I will definitely stay with Sarah for another time on my visit to Boston in the future."
1850260,11741977,2014-04-14,8300713,Rachel,"When I arrived, Sarah was not actually around as she had just stepped out, but I was instead greeted by her little son who was absolutely adorable and showed us around to our room. :) So cute. The room was pretty much as described; I think what was provided for the price was fair. Toilet needs to be jiggled a little in order to flush but we figured it out pretty quickly; it's not broken or anything. The blankets provided were thin but the room itself was warmer than it was outside so we actually needed to pull out the mini-fan (provided in the closet) more than we needed the blanket, haha. When I did finally get to meet Sarah, she greeted me and my boyfriend so warmly and with a big hug! My only regret is that my schedule was so tight that I didn't have much time to sit around and have a chat with everyone there... Would recommend this room to anyone who is looking to stay in Boston on a budget! The location is very convenient too; I didn't take any public transportation but using Uber, I was able to get where I needed to be in less than 20 minutes and for less than 10 dollars!"
1850260,11954781,2014-04-20,3633997,Steev,"Comfortable 3rd floor bedroom within a short walk to stores & public transport. The hostess and her family are very friendly & welcoming. Street parking is available 6 pm to 8 am right out front, but not during the day. "
1850260,12348034,2014-04-29,2280297,Daniel,"Sarah was a wonderful and accomodating host.  She and her family are very friendly and welcoming as I conversed with Sarah, her younger brother, and even her son at times during my trip and definitely enjoyed my stay in Boston, MA, despite the cold rainy weather.  I accidentally booked my stay 1 day too short and Sarah took care the reservation adjustment for the extra last day without any troubles. The 3rd floor room (2 are available) has its own bathroom and is comfortable.  It is easy to come and go as you please. The home is a short walk to public transport (Dudley bus station is only 3 blocks away).  I initially took a taxi to her place, but changed to public transportation or Uber after the airport taxi driver over charged me according to my host.  I was in town for a medical conference at the the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC) and found the best route was to walk 5 mins to Dudley Station and take a 5 min bus ride to Ruggles Train Station, which only cost $2.  Then I took the MBTA subway for $2.50 to the BCEC (orange route N to [at downtown crossing stop] red route S to [at south station stop] silver route W [exited to BCEC at World Trade Center stop).  The duration of walk/bus/subway route was on average 30 to 45 mins.  When I was in a hurry, I used Uber instead and it costs $9 on average and took 10 to 15 mins."
1850260,12459081,2014-05-03,8717252,Shari,"Sarah and her brother Sam were so warm and friendly. The room was very comfortable and had everything I needed! Sarah and Sam were always available for assistance with directions, even walked with me to hail a cab and show me where the bus stop was located! Just visiting at the end of the day having a good conversation with them was a pleasure! I very much enjoyed their hospitality and look forward to seeing them again!"
1850260,12627789,2014-05-06,8540240,Naiomi,"The room was as pictured and described. Sarah and her family warmly received us and made sure we felt welcome. The room was clean and comfy with windows that could open easily. The room is on the third floor so it was warmer than outside, but opening the windows really helped. I was in and out most of the time and didn't spend much time with Sarah or her family but they were very accommodating to ensure our stay was as promised. The condo is 2 short blocks from the Dudley Station making it easy to access public transport."
1850260,12891896,2014-05-13,13717018,Carlos,"It has been a pleasure to meet Sarah and her family. We have had a nice experience. If I have the chance, I will go back for sure. :)"
1850260,13078625,2014-05-19,13752210,Lena,"This was my first time in Boston, so I didn't know the various areas and I was thrown off by reviews for this space. I wish I had the feedback that I'm providing now -  to base my decision on where to stay. 

I'm sure Sarah and Sam are nice people, but the location of this space is questionable. Buyers beware - you get what you paid for. 

Location - this house is located at the Dudley Square Silver Line T stop (which is a BUS, no trains are close to this location). It's a dead end bus stop - as grim as it gets. Smelly, dirt and trash everywhere...homeless people. Is this really the heart of Boston?

Neighborhood - about a 3 block walk, it's not the  cleanest and a bit (URL HIDDEN) 11:30 am on a Thursday morning, people are hanging out in front if their houses (no jobs?), thumping music, loud conversations that are clearly heard even once you are inside the house. 

Sam met us - he was nice. Showed us around the house. Took us to our room. Room/bed exactly as pictured. Nothing more, nothing less. 

The location and neighborhood just wasn't for us. We rented a hotel room, ordered a cab to pick us up at the house and took off. The remainder of the trip was great, Boston is a neat city! 

Good luck!


"
1850260,13156073,2014-05-20,14101914,Kaitlyn,Sarah was a great host who made sure you had everything you needed. Location is close to some bus stops which will connect you to the subway - we decided to park in the Back Bay area for the day instead. Free parking on the street on the weekends until 8am on Monday. 
1850260,13346346,2014-05-26,44502,Linda,"What was your experience with the host?
Sarah and her brother, Sam, are very warm and loving hosts.  Made us feel incredibly welcome and were very helpful.  Sarah's son is an absolute delight.  Sam brought our luggage upstairs for us!  They have a small fridge just for guests, and provided basics for making breakfast.

Was the listing what you expected?  
The room (spacious) is almost exactly as pictured - in addition there is a computer desk and chair which are not shown (a big plus).  Another plus is that there are easily accessible electric outlets.  The closet is huge, with lots of hangers and plenty of space for luggage.  Because Sarah and Sam are from Nigeria, they are accustomed to a very warm climate, so they keep the house warmer than is typical in the US.  That said, our room had two windows which could be easily opened to cool down the room (that did make it a bit noisy at times).  The bed was good.

What was their neighborhood like?
This was the only negative.  While I never felt unsafe (realize, however, that I grew up in Oakland, CA), the neighborhood is border line.  Starting before 5 pm and lasting into the wee hours there were a group of men that gathered at the curb in front of the apartment.  They were not intrusive or obnoxious, but one did have to walk between them to enter or exit the apartment.    
"
1850260,14122867,2014-06-12,487253,Lars,"My mom stayed with Sarah and had a great experience there. Sarah and her family were really great hosts, and the room and facilities were good. The location is good, very close to downtown and easily accesible and in a diverse, friendly neighborhood.
Thanks."
1850260,14294897,2014-06-16,15146242,Belinda,"(I'm not native english, sorry for the mistakes)
Sarah is a very nice host. We arrive earlier and have been nicely welcomed by his soon who is nice and showed us everything. The room is very big with a hude closet and the bathroom is just next, it's situated in the 3rd floor.
Big TV, bed is comfy, nothing bad too say; Same for the bathroom. Clean house,
The district is close from downtown by bus (i would say 10/15min); The area in itself is good, safe, people are outside on chairs, very cool. South end is a very nice district and you can reach it walking, 5min, a lot of restaurants, nice houses.
What we preferred in total was Sarah and her family, they are all very welcoming, warm people, we had the chance to have a good conversation with them, they truly like receiving people and it was a pleasure for us meeting them.

Sarah et sa famille sont des personnes très accueillantes et chaleureuses,La chambre est simple mais satisfaisante d'autant plus qu'il y a beaucoup d'espace. La maison est propre et le quartier animé mais safe et agréable (maison colorées, musique, les personnes assises devant les maisons...). Je recommande cet endroit surtout pour Sarah son accueil. Se trouve à 10/15 minutes en bus du centre. A voir: south end qui se trouve à 5minutes à pied et le quartier en lui même mérite une balade."
1850260,14380249,2014-06-17,5378761,Shivani,"Sarah was a wonderful host to us. My boyfriend and I were only visiting for one night, but needed to leave our suitcases in the place during the following day. She was very flexible with us!
The place was great too. She 'upgraded' our room to a king-size bed. It was very comfortable, and we had everything we needed.

The location is a little further from all the 'touristy' places in Boston, but it was extremely easy to get to/from there, from downtown, or Harvard/MIT, or even the airport. The main bus line ends just a few short blocks from her place, which means we were able to catch a bus to basically anywhere from there.

All in all, great experience, and would definitely consider staying there again!"
1850260,14459808,2014-06-19,16928263,Ruben,"Great person, fast response. Basic room. Good price! A little noisy outside the house, so bring earplugs. "
1850260,14565094,2014-06-22,2995203,Lisa,"Sarah and her family were very warm and welcoming. The room is just as it appears in the photo. I stayed three (3) nights for a conference I was attending  downtown. However, this room and location are not for everyone who needs a place to stay in Boston.

First, the room is on the third floor and requires walking up two flights of steep steps once inside the home. This could be problematic if a person has trouble with steps or has a heavy suitcase to lift.

Second, there was no air conditioning on in the home and the room was very hot at night. Although there was a fan and the window was open, it was still warm at night. This was mid-June.

Third, the sheets and bedspread were made out of a slippery polyester type of material that made me sweat at night. I would have preferred cotton sheets and cotton pillow cases.

Fourth, (and most important for me) was that I am not used to city living. I returned from conference between 9-11pm and there were always people socializing in the courtyard in front of the front door. This made me nervous as I got out of my taxi (Uber). Nothing bad happened but I was not comfortable going out at night in that neighborhood. 

In sum, if you need an affordable place to stay just a short bus or Uber ride to downtown, you may want to consider this location."
1850260,14730910,2014-06-25,12668109,Liz,"Sarah and her brother Sam were great hosts who were very responsive to all of our needs. The bed was great, the room very spacious and the bathroom had anything we might need.  We enjoyed staying with Sarah and the interaction with her other guests. "
1850260,14790160,2014-06-26,15543298,Salome,"It was a most favorable stay at Sarah's place. I only slept there for one night but Sarah and her family made it easy to make me feel at home immediately.
Extremely nice people + a room where you couldn't ask for more. Top!!"
1850260,14924998,2014-06-29,6136798,Chance,"Sarah and her family are very generous people who treated me like a real guest in their house, they even cooked me some delicious fried plantains. The room is big and clean and the apartment is close to downtown. "
1850260,15585325,2014-07-12,9914207,Stuart,"Sarah was a very gracious host, even cooking a meal for me upon arrival! Room was very spacious and having a private bathroom was another good feature. Be warned that you are going up two flights of stairs to your room! "
1850260,15717541,2014-07-14,8050050,Jenileigh,"Sarah and her family were very nice and welcoming. However, if you plan on walking, the location of their place was less than ideal for seeing downtown Boston. Also, their neighbors were extremely loud throughout the night and it was pretty hot in the top floor room with no AC – together, this made it difficult to sleep. "
1850260,15909328,2014-07-18,15370940,Alexandre,"Sarah and his family are very nice and very friendly people ! We felt like home !
The room is very comfortable and well located (20 mn to Boston downtown by bus).
Despite its bad reputation, we never felt unsecure in the area of Roxbury (people were really helpful 
and friendly).

1850260,16130468,2014-07-22,5431922,Jerome,"L'hote a été très accueillante et a fait en sorte que nous nous sentions bien chez elle.
Le quartier est un peu bruyant, en fait le voisinage...
La chambre et les parties communes étaient propres et correspondaient à la description. Pas de mauvaise surprise...
Le quartier est ""populaire""... avec ses plus et ses moins...
Facile à trouver avec le bus sl4 jusqu'au terminus."

1850260,16564007,2014-07-29,16926812,Charles,"Our host (Sarah) and her family (son Desmond and brother Sam) were all very friendly and warm, and they were concerned about the quality of our stay.  

Our room was one of three that Sarah lists on airbnb, and there was a very international flair to her guests and her home.  We enjoyed our all too brief interactions with everyone we met.  Sarah's apartment building is in easy walking distance to the Dudley Station (served by buses), and connections to other buses and to the subway system was easy.  The neighborhood is residential, and townhouses were colorful, neat and clean.  The accommodations in the apartment were clean and comfortable.  We shared a bathroom with guests from one other room, and had access to the kitchen and to a small, shared refrigerator.  From our bedroom, we heard some night-time noises - kids playing street games, young adults listening to music.  We very much enjoyed the cross-cultural experience if not the taste in music.  

Sarah, Desmond, and Sam are all delightful and interesting people, and our only regret is that we didn't get to know them better.  
"
1850260,16688562,2014-07-31,17798328,Michele,"Sarah was very friendly and the house was as described, her son is very helpful. The neighbours were a little bit noisy at night but it didn't bother us. The house is close to the bus station but it is far from the subway. Conclusion: I recommend the place."
1850260,16891953,2014-08-04,2201621,Lisa,"We stayed 2 days at Sarah's place. Room was exactly as displayed in the pictures - maybe even bigger. Sarah and her family are really welcoming and generous people. They genuinely like having people in their house but were also absolutely respectful of our privacy. Location is perfect, 2 minutes walking distance from Dudley station - from where you can reach every area of Boston. If we come back to Sarah, we will for sure stay at her place!"
1850260,17008143,2014-08-05,18233755,Alex,"Sarah was great. She was very helpful when we got there. The room was just as it is displayed in the picture, it feels that it is bigger actually! If you wanna talk about football (as in soccer), her brother is the way to go aswell!"
1850260,17489371,2014-08-12,16398817,Arlinna,"I did not get the chance to meet Sarah, but i think she must be very nice. Her brother Sam was nice also and helpful. The room is clean and comfortable. I spent two good night with my friend there. The location of Sarah's house is near the bus station to downtown and the airport. There were parties during the weekend around the neighbourhood, so it was a bit noisy, but maybe the trip was too tired for me and my friend, so that did not bother us too much. Plus, the neighbourhood was very friendly and willing to help also. "
1850260,17660405,2014-08-15,12000924,Selke,"Very friendly host, warm welcome, nice room. "
1850260,17968718,2014-08-19,1194059,Yvonne,"   My experience at Sarah's house was great.  My room was spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed, a small computer desk and a large, comfortable armchair.  I had easy access to a nice bathroom.  My hosts' home was also close to a T stop and, if I had been staying longer, it would have been really easy to get around Boston from their home.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Sarah when I stayed at her house, she had gone on vacation.  Her brother Sam was taking care of the house and was very attentive and considerate host.   I'd consider staying at this residence again."
1850260,18454849,2014-08-26,566075,Daphny,"My SO and I stayed in one of Sarah's rooms for a day. We didn't get to meet Sarah but her brother Sam gave us a warm welcome. They were very accommodating and allowed us to check in very late (thanks again!) They provided us with water, coffee and a few items for breakfast. As other visitors have noted, there isn't a/c but thankfully the fan was sufficient.

The only drawback to this listing is its location. If I wasn't traveling with my SO, I wouldn't have felt comfortable staying there. As a woman, I would have been concerned about the shady looking men that loitered around and being so close to several poorly maintained public housing projects. I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends but if your comfortable with staying in such a neighborhood and you're street smart, you'll be fine."

Das Haus und das Zimmer waren sauber und liegen sehr gut, kaum 5 min. Weg zur dudley station und von dort direkt nach downtown.
Leider feierten die Nachbarn an einem Dienstag wieder sehr laut und lange, so dass schlafen kaum möglich war. Die Wände sind insgesamt sehr hellhörig und wenn alle drei Zimmer vermietet sind wird es sehr eng.

I was on a trip to visit my father's best college friend in Boston, and he insisted that I stay at his place for that night. It was already quite late in the night, so I have to send Sarah a message that I can't make it. Anyway, she was nice and didn't blame me much. Hope we can have another chance to meet. "

1850260,22642072,2014-11-11,5801851,Riccardo,"I had booked the room for the period between november 7th to november 11th for myself. Later I had to change my reservation from nov 6 to nov 10 and add a guest with me. Sarah and Sam (her brother) have immediately been at our disposal. So, the other guest has simply paid an extra price, as it is right, and everything was ok. 
When arrived in Boston we phoned Sam and he has come to South Station to pick us up by his car and show us the house.  Actually it was a house in Moreland Street and then he told us that we could stay there or going to Bethune way. I talk about the house in Moreland Street and have to say that it is very large, very comfortable, very safe, very well heated (it's up to us to choose the temperature,) very quiet. We can use the kitchen, the extra large bathroom, the large living room with a big tv. Towels are at our disposal and we have bottles of water if needed. 
On Sunday I saw Sarah in the house and she was very very sweet and kind. 
There is absolutely no problem with this house and with these people. So, i would suggest everyone to choose them.
I read other reviews and someone worries about the location, though. Well. By walking 500m south you arrive to Dudley Station, where some useful buses start: for example the 1 to Harvard Square, the sl4 and sl5 to South Station and Downtown crossing, the sl1 to the airport. In only 15minutes by bus you are in the centre of Boston.  
That's it. I only have to rethank Sarah and Sam because my joruney in Boston was very beautiful even because their house was it."
1850260,23084513,2014-11-22,23824838,Michael,"Sarah greeted me into her home with a hug. It was her and her son. She was extremely friendly and curtious, a real sweet heart. House is in a neighborhood that seemed safe, even walking at night. Some night time neighborhood music noise. 5 min walk to Chinese food, joes famous subs, corner grocer. 10 minute walk to Boston medical center. Sarah and her son are both kind souls and you will surely feel welcome into her home, you are treated like a visiting friend rather than a tenant. I will surely go back if I am in the area in need of lodgings again"
1850260,23257001,2014-11-26,23434690,Lehaz,Large and clean room in the center of Boston. Sarah is very kind and easygoing person. 
1850260,23571856,2014-12-05,10155636,Theo,"A really nice stay. Sarah is very hospitable, and the room is very comfortable. You have your own privacy. The neighbourhood is very quiet, calm and pleasant. Close to all public transportations, shops and downtown. A very good adress !"
1850260,23620937,2014-12-06,13738900,Duy,Sarah & Sampson were amazing & truly became friends of mine! Sarah assisted me with various options and was very flexible in my accommodation needs! It is my intent to stay here again in the future! They are both very ethical and simply sweet people!
1850260,23984299,2014-12-15,22828347,E,"Parking was easy and adjacent to the buildings and saw host once. Sarah and her son have a graceful demeanor. 
The only coffee was instant decaf-with-milk premix. Bfast is bread and jam. Had to get my own bath soap: The only bath soap were a couple of used bars and there was no hand soap.  Toiletries needed restocking. 
The room and bed were spacious, on its own floor, with a door lock. 
The neighborhood was noisy: yelling at night and music from neighbors echoed clearly through closed windows/door.  If you're a heavy sleeper: not an issue. 
I would not walk in this neighborhood too late and too often. "

1850260,24695604,2015-01-01,23359515,Sheenal,"Even though my partner and i did not actually stay there, sarah was very welcoming and extremely nice! you have your own floor and bathroom!"
1850260,24991960,2015-01-04,17630159,Josef,Next time I'm in Boston I'd stay in Sarah's place.
1850260,25316841,2015-01-12,13178668,Jacqueline,"My staying at Sarah was a bless! She is an incredibly nice host, she made me feel truly welcomed. The bedroom was really nice, I could watch TV in the evening right before going to bed! I found that the wifi signal wasnt't very strong, but I'm note sure if it's a problem with my cellphone or Sarah's wifi. The bed was so comfortable! Bread, milk and orange juice was provided as part of the 'bed and breakfast' with was really nice because you usually don't have time to go grocery shopping before checking in! There is a bus station/terminal literally five minutes away, that was truly useful. I'll definitely check Sarah again if I ever come back to Boston! - Eleonore"
1850260,26546980,2015-02-15,26709823,David,Great first time experience using airbnb. The place was as described. I would go back.
1850260,27412186,2015-03-03,22272756,Assem,"Sarah was an excellent host, I really thank here for her hospitality, I stayed for 3 nights and found the whole place very comfortable and quiet.. I highly recommend this place in the heart of Boston. "
1850260,27733836,2015-03-10,24582598,Sukreet,"Sarah was a very warm and welcoming host. The room was comfy as advertised! The bathroom was stocked with supplies that ill prepared travelers would find very useful. Her place is a very short walk from Dudley station and was extremely convenient for me. 
Thank you Sarah!"
1850260,27967856,2015-03-15,28888597,Kimberley,Sarah was very welcoming and friendly when we arrived. 
1850260,28287942,2015-03-21,29462307,Sally,"Sarah is a very friendly, welcoming, smiling host. She left me to 'do my own thing' but was helpful when needed. The room was lovely! Transport to downtown Boston is very close."
1850260,28656231,2015-03-28,27756951,Hannah & Philip,"Sarah was very sweet and welcoming!  The room is simple, as described, and the location is great.  "
1850260,29076256,2015-04-03,9684323,Irina,"Great location, very close to the downtown and Fine art museum. A lot of wonderful cafees in walking distance. Sarah is really nice person, she gave me warm welcome. 
Place is really quiet, so I slept two nights well. Very clean bathroom. Very comfortable bed.
"
1850260,29515903,2015-04-08,8869602,Boas,"I had a wonderful experience staying at Sarah's. The place is near public transport, quite and safe and I felt so at home. 

I definitely would chose to stay here next time I visit Boston. "
1850260,29759773,2015-04-12,26382992,Amy,"I loved staying with Sarah and her little gentleman of a 10-year-old son. Sarah is just a warm, wonderful, kind person. The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable, and I was very happy I stayed there. It's a bit away from, say, Boston Common; however, Uber rides to (URL HIDDEN) 120 Tremont Street, for example, are only about $10 and they come within five minutes. Again, Sarah is a lovely person and you will feel very welcome at her place."
1850260,30093591,2015-04-17,25966382,René,"Sarah was such a lovely host. She went out of her way to make sure I was well received and my stay was pleasant. 

The room itself was very comfortable and clean. I usually have trouble sleeping away from home, but the bed was so comfortable that I always woke up refreshed.

There's not much to do around the neighborhood itself, but it's a short bus ride from the town center. Around 10 to 15 mins. 

Highly recommend it.
"
1850260,30435024,2015-04-21,31523922,Sharon,Sarah was great- very welcoming. Greeted me with a hug. Thanks for the room!
1850260,30538165,2015-04-23,17542906,Aakriti,Sarah is a super nice host and her son as well. We requested this room on an extremely late notice and were still given a room which was very nice :) 
1850260,30989626,2015-04-30,28574024,Hilde,"Sarah was very kind, it was no problem to come a little earlier and she gave me all the information I needed. It was a bit farther from the city centre than I initially expected but that was no problem. "
1850260,32165784,2015-05-15,27578688,Girish,She is very caring and friendly.
1850260,32750744,2015-05-21,16578722,Robin,Nice room and friendly host.  Very convenient to Northeastern.
1850260,33519623,2015-05-29,31932015,Ginger,"My hostess and her son made me feel VERY welcome! I was worried that I was ""so far away"" from the convention center, but I never paid more than $11 on a non-taxi ride service for each way. 
The room was very clean, the bed comfortable, and the room was very quiet. "
1850260,33639610,2015-05-30,34528874,Ronan,"Sarah, you are an amazing host and I hope to see you on the beach soon! "
1850260,33684256,2015-05-31,2611679,Claudia,"Sarah's place has convenient location. The place is fine but If you are a person extremely strict about cleanness like my self, I felt uncomfortable in this place. I think it's so important to provide white linens and towels. I feel very uncomfortable sleeping in a place with dark color linens when the place is use by many different people.
Claudia"
1850260,34201545,2015-06-06,30116421,Saul,"Sarah was a brilliant host, was very welcoming and helpful throughout our stay and made us feel comfortable in her home. The room was a great size with a king size bed, walk in wardrobe and a big TV. The bathroom was fine and right next to our room like an en suit. The house is a two minute walk to the bus station which is really useful as you can get to basically anywhere you  want to go from there. Overall, we had a very enjoyable time staying at Sarah's and she was very kind and helpful host. "
1850260,34953840,2015-06-14,30407839,Francesco,"I really liked my time spent at sarah's. She was very kind and welcoming to me all the time. The listing is accurate and the neighborhood is a quiet place, people always greets you on the street and the location is very well served by bus/metro/public service, any time of the day. In 20min you can get pretty much wherever you want in Boston. The room is big, the bed is comfortable, the furniture very essential but it's ok! Both my room and the guests bathroom were clean. One thing I really appreciated is the flexible level of privacy: if you want to chat a bit you can typically reach to Sarah in the living room, otherwise you can just lock yourself in your room. Sarah is very professional in that. Overall, I would choose Sarah again for a future trip in Boston! Thank you."
1850260,35257589,2015-06-16,626531,Jonathan & Nassia,"Staying with Sara was great! She's SO sweet and her apartment is very convenient for getting in, out and all around Boston. Parking is super easy and there's a major bus terminal near by as well as a Hubway bike port, all within a 5 minute walk... The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable (we slept great!) ...Highly recommend!"
1850260,35298154,2015-06-17,31002073,Jacob,Great stay. Sarah was very kind throughout. 
1850260,35430801,2015-06-18,34773895,Marchelle,Sara was very nice! She wasn't there when I arrived but she made it easy for me as her son showed me my room and the bathroom was right next door. The neighborhood didn't seem like the safest at night but it was nice during the day. Sara was very welcoming and we had a nice conversation. I might plan on bringing you own breakfast or going out though because there is not a big selection. It was about a $30 can ride from the airport and $10 to downtown.
1850260,36208101,2015-06-26,34868756,Zwelakhe-Duma,"Was so delighted to stay at Sarah's establiment. The room was just as pictured, very clean, very spacious, very organized. Sarah, is so helpful and welcoming, as always on call for support at anytime. "
1850260,36876402,2015-07-02,33624136,Bram,"So first of all, Sarah's great and she really wants you to be comfortable. I had no problems at all during my stay and was even pleasantly surprised a few times by her hospitality. All the default things you would get in a hotel you also get here and if you want either privacy or a bit of a chat, both are fine with her. She's very open minded and I think we had a few nice talks about a broad range of subjects.

If you are looking for a place to stay in Boston for a short period I would definitely recommend Sarah, the price to 'what you get' ratio is very good and it is close to bus connections going downtown.

If you are hesitant about booking (like I myself was) stop being hesitant and go for it, you won't be dissapointed!"
1850260,37026407,2015-07-03,37255028,Gabe,Sarah was one of the nicest people I have ever met. She greets you with the warmest hug you will ever receive in your entire life. Make sure to take the taxi for the first time there.
1850260,37086739,2015-07-04,25600730,Dennis,"Great stay! Very comfortable, clean and spacious room. It was easy getting everywhere in Boston even at night."
1850260,37344945,2015-07-06,7263154,Elena,Sarah is a welcoming host! I had a great experience staying at her home. She is a lovely lady and takes a wonderful care of her guests. I would recommend her listing with pleasure!
1850260,37661528,2015-07-09,33161764,Yiwei,"I enjoyed my stay at Sarah's home. She and her son are nice, friendly, and polite. The room is exactly as described in the website. The location is convenient. Easy to get on the bus. The Wifi is free and fast. The shower is great. The bed is comfortable. And they are very helpful. Thanks Sarah.  "
1850260,38296523,2015-07-14,15062355,Adélie,"Sarah is really nice and welcoming. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay in Boston, this is it! The silver line bus is at the corner, no nead for a taxi."
1850260,38440462,2015-07-15,2149004,Eric,"Sarah was very warm and welcoming. I only stayed for one night, but I could tell through our limited interaction that Sarah was a very kind and gracious host. "
1850260,38920893,2015-07-19,22447380,Morgan,"Sarah's place is lovely, and well located in the city (close to Silver line buses to downtown, bus 1 to Cambridge, etc). Sarah is a great host, always here to talk, and very nice. The only drawback is that it can be a bit noisy at night, but nothing dramatic. "
1850260,39827841,2015-07-26,37789580,Matthew,"I stayed there two nights and was gone most of the time, but Sarah was very nice and accommodating. Wifi, TV,  and a few simple breakfast items included."
1850260,40245328,2015-07-29,37383431,Clarina,"Just want to say thank you for the wonderful experience  living with a family in Boston. Our host Sarah was very welcoming. She made sure our stay was very pleasant and really felt at home. The room was as described Comfy Room and the location was very central in Boston and we could easily travel around the city by public transport( bus/train) as well as by taxi. 
Will definitely stay here again and again."
1850260,41207037,2015-08-05,34079310,Yousef,"Our stay was great! We got early to Boston so I asked Sara if we can drop our stuff there and hangout in the city before the check-in and she let us do that! 
The room is as described. We visited Boston on early August so the weather was pretty humid. The room had a big fan and I guess we were not used to the Boston humidity in the season so we had a hard time the first night. When we shared our experience with her she gave us a portable AC unit that really saved us. 
We did not quite liked the neighborhood but I heard from her that she is moving away in a few days so that shouldn't be a problem any more. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay in Boston. Sara is a nice lady and I recommend her place for your stay. "
1850260,41451606,2015-08-07,13680289,Akash,"It was nice experience at Sarah's place. I was promptly given a tour upon arrival, the bedroom and bathroom were neat and tidy.
Sarah accommodated my request to use the washer, this helped a lot as I had been travelling for quite a while.
There was coffee, milk, cereal for breakfast but I didn't use as I was in a hurry.
The only downside to this was that it felt a bit overpriced for the location, $10-15 less would've been perfect..."
1850260,41497884,2015-08-07,39934928,Lorenzo,"Sarah is a very nice and kind person, I had a wonderful and peaceful stay here in Boston."
1850260,41649156,2015-08-08,31355733,Stella,"Amazing host! Sarah is very friendly and extremely responsive. The room was nice, clean, and as advertised. Thank you!"
1850260,43637259,2015-08-21,37427094,Robert,I stayed for 2 nights and I enjoyed it very much. It is a lovely room in a very nice flat. It's not very close to downtown but the bus station ist just 3 minutes from the house.
1850260,44410978,2015-08-26,32975820,Pesti,"Sarah is a kind,caring and lovely lady. I've had a great time chatting with her. The room was spacious,cleand and felt like home in the whole house. Fast internet,tv and breakfast. Very close to Dudley Square station. Thank you Sarah for everything! :)"
1850260,44605242,2015-08-27,41092471,Joseph,Very nice experience.
1850260,45138352,2015-08-31,40566100,Zachary,"Everything was fine.  Roxbury isn't the safest area in Boston, but we knew this going in and had no issues.  "
1850260,45406390,2015-09-02,36943008,Katrien,"Sarah is a warm and kind person and a good host. The accomodations were a bit less than we expected, due to the fact that Sarah just moved and the rooms weren't fully ready, we knew only a few days beforehand that it would be a different adress than the one we saw on the site. In that aspect it's not so nice to still pay the same amount, but Sarah really did her very best to get things in order as quickly as possible. We were offered breakfast if we wanted and she was also very helpfull getting us a taxi when we needed to get to the airport. 
For the guest staying after us everything was probably perfect. All in all we would recommend sarah."
1850260,45536055,2015-09-03,42919227,Claire,"Sarah is a nice and respectful host. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and close to Dudley station, which is convenient. The bedroom is just as on the picture. "
1850260,45990238,2015-09-07,1280688,Samantha,"Sarah was very prompt at replying to any questions I had. She had moved to a new address after I had booked my trip with her but she was very professional and made sure she gave me advanced notice of the new address prior to my arrival. Her home is very large and clean. I only had an opportunity to speak with her upon my arrival but she and her son seem very lovely. Regarding the room: very clean, fresh towels and quiet. The neighborhood is fine and you will be safe. She is a close walk to major buses. The only two issues I had were that there was no wifi available during my stay so if you don't have a smartphone this is something to consider.  The second, was the upstairs shower works very well and has hot water but the pressure is very strong so be careful to not get the floor wet. However, I highly recommend this home as a place to stay! Thank you very much Sarah!"
1850260,47286828,2015-09-17,35860048,Basil,"Sarah has a lovely home which is easily accessible to the rest of the city. One bus and you are in the downtown area by the common. 

She is also very welcoming and helpful. It all helped me have a great experience in Boston. I would recommend anyone to stay here. It's less expensive than somewhere further in but just as convenient."
1850260,47429012,2015-09-18,39929907,Jennelle,"Very nice room and bathroom, even better than in the picture. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was clean.  I arrived rather late and the host waited up to meet me. She made sure to go through everything with me even though it was very late night. Parking was convenient - right outside. For those who are concerned about the neighborhood, I never felt unsafe as a single woman traveling alone. Also, the price was great for the accommodations. I would stay here again."
1850260,47859622,2015-09-21,6898522,Camilla,"The host is welcoming, generous and friendly and really helpful .
The room is big and clean.
The flat is situated close to public transport and good restaurant areas."
1850260,47996946,2015-09-22,14725669,Manuela,"Sarah's Zimmer war sehr schön, allerdings ca 20 Minuten Busfahrt von Boston downtown entfernt. Die Busse fuhren allerdings regelmäßig alle 10 Minuten.

"
1850260,48292558,2015-09-25,41369037,Chunyan,"Overall, the room is big and clean, however the wifi was really slow, and completely lost signals on the last day. Sarah and her son are friendly and welcoming. "
1850260,48889953,2015-09-29,4825805,Anne,Sarah was warm & welcoming. Her newly renovated rented home is spacious and comfortable. Kitchen facilities were excellent. The only negative was the two spiral staircases we had to climb to our room on the 3rd floor. The bedroom was spacious and the bed comfortable.  We had the bathroom to ourselves which was nice but the toilet seat was very loose. Sarah will have this attended to. The home was located close to public transport for Downtown and there is an excellent supermarket within walking distance.
1850260,49341481,2015-10-03,36546368,Apar,"Cozy stay, very clean. Would recommend to anyone!
Sarah and her family make you feel at home."
1850260,50188101,2015-10-10,43120938,Mai,"The room was clean, comfortable and I had good sleep. . The house is nicely decorated and bathroom is clean. It took 20-30 minutes by silver line to get to the city center where the attractions are. The neighborhood is ok at day time, but one should not walk home alone after dark since it is pretty deserted. WiFi is good and fast. I did not talk much to Sarah but she seemed nice. One thing that can be improved is to provide the directions to the place with public transport."
1850260,50659703,2015-10-13,41862480,Francesca,"The house is big and in a good position, is not close to the town centre but close to a bus station that drive you everywhere. Our room was in the top floor, big and tidy. We shared a fridge and the toilet with only another room. Sarah is kind. "
1850260,50830016,2015-10-15,13831235,Gordon,"Spent a comfortable 2 nights at Sarah's apartment (on two floors of a large house). The room is large and has an air-conditioning unit (which I didn't need) and an overhead fan. The bathroom is also large and I shared it with another Airbnb guest. If you are travelling by car there is plenty of parking space on the street. The apartment is located several miles from the downtown tourist attractions but is well served by buses at the nearby bus station which provide destinations for subway stations. There are machines at the bus station where you can buy 1-day ""Charlie"" tickets."
1850260,51726257,2015-10-24,43066270,Christopher,Sehr nette Gastgeberin. Zimmerbeschreibung hat sehr gut gepasst. Zimmer und Bad waren sehr sauber. Die Dusche war für deutsche Ansprüche allerdings in einem dürftigen Zustand (selbstgebaut?). Insgesamt kann ich das Zimmer nur weiterempfehlen.
1850260,51961640,2015-10-25,2802044,Gernot,Very friendly and nice hosts! Clean and comfortable room; I can really recommend this place.
1850260,52439168,2015-10-29,46630225,Luke,What a great first air BnB experience! Sarah made my stay comfortable and her house was within 15 minutes of the convention center. I would highly recommend staying here.
1850260,53023871,2015-11-03,46291011,Tahsin,"The son greeted me, I was expecting Sarah but thats fine. Very sweet kid showed me around. Met Sarah later, she was also nice. The room was fine for the price, a little hot but cleared up with ceiling fan. You have bathroom to yourself if no one else is renting the other room on this floor. Overall the room was fine. 
BUT the neighborhood was really sketchy. I did not feel safe walking around during the day, would not even think of going out during the night. I had a car so I felt somewhat safe that I could just go back and forth to my car at least. I didn't check out public transport. Wouldn't mind coming back to this host's service but only if in another safer neighborhood!"
1850260,53201210,2015-11-06,21822681,Ahmed,"Sarah was very helpful and welcoming. I really felt like i was home, though i was far away from home. "
1850260,53798773,2015-11-12,48601742,Olivia,"Sarah was a wonderful host! I felt welcome the moment I walked into her home and she let me know everything I needed right away. The room and bathroom were so clean and the bed was nice and comfy :)
It was great to talk to Sarah when I came in each night; she definitely creates a welcoming atmosphere! Thanks so much Sarah."
1850260,54358323,2015-11-18,46803574,Patrick,"Bon accueil, bon échange malgré la barrière de la langue. Sarah a su réagir la deuxième nuit à un problème  de chauffage dans la chambe la première nuit."
1850260,55704454,2015-12-04,30546141,Mark,"Everyone made me feel so welcome. Good people! It's a joyful house. Magical. Musical. And the conversations in the kitchen, very international, very savvy. "
1850260,56293749,2015-12-11,30546141,Mark,"Wonderful and welcoming, Sarah's home is a warm and a true joy to stay in.v"
1850260,57328771,2015-12-24,33725363,Di,"Great experience  warm cosy clean room
Sarah kind enough to drive us to hire car place one morning"
1850260,59653745,2016-01-13,31040794,Leon,"This is a great price for a room in Boston. I stayed 6 nights. Roxbury is a big city neighborhood, so be aware and don't expect trimmed lawns and gated communities. If you enjoy real cities, you'll be fine. The house is nice, and there's a major bus terminal just down the hill."
1850260,61540370,2016-02-05,55803742,Travis,"Sarah was nice, warm, and welcoming. Her home was beautiful and my room was clean, private, and quiet. "
1850260,61963706,2016-02-09,12499511,Max,"Sarah was not there when I arrived but her sister let me in and showed me to the room. Its up 2 staircases that are quite narrow so it was a bit difficult getting up there while trying not to ruin the walls. The room was somewhat dark and cold, but I asked for an additional space heater and she gladly gave it to me. Other than that, I had almost zero interaction with anyone in the house. The bathroom was adequate and it was all mine since there was no one staying in the adjacent room. The place was very close to Boston Medical Center which is really all I cared about, but the neighborhood doesn't have a the best feel to it. I cannot comment on safety since I drove in on a very snowy day and the streets were essentially empty. The house was quiet and a bit cold, but other than that it was a good value for what I needed."
1850260,65109563,2016-03-10,5290002,Jason,"I was just there for a quick night's sleep while travelling. The bed was cozy, and I had the bathroom all to myself since no one was staying across the hall."
1850260,65903462,2016-03-17,905455,Alicia,"Sarah was very friendly and communicative. Her family members were also very welcoming. It was the first time I've stayed in a room in a shared house, and I was pretty nervous about having to share space with other people. I didn't find it awkward or weird at all. Quite the opposite."
1850260,66223695,2016-03-20,23308080,Sheri,"Clean, quiet, homey. Hostess was very helpful in answering questions and recommending me to take advantage of Boston's Metro Cab service since I was unfamiliar with local transportation. "
1850260,66660947,2016-03-24,46021156,Ulf,"VI hade kontakt i god tid före min ankomst och jag ändrade från att komma ensam till att ta med en kompis, och sen tillbaka till ensamboende utan problem. Sarah var även hemma för att släppa in mig vis ankomst ca 22.30 trots att hon var på väg till sitt nattjobb. Allt som var annonserat fanns på plats. Lite långt från centrum men med buss (för en kostnad av 2.60 USD) kom man till South station eller downtown."
1850260,71288822,2016-04-24,3246735,Randy,Sarah was such a pleasure and helpful. Her house was very welcoming and clean! She was such a good spirit. The room was very cozy and relaxing and the bathroom was very clean. The area was very easy to navigate. Its was quick walk to the nearest bus station. I would love to stay there again the next time I visit Boston. Thanks Sarah!
1850260,73931581,2016-05-11,10834146,Archana,My stay was very pleasant. Host was kind and considerate. Lovely home she opened up to me with. Very trusting and I felt safe being in Boston my first time. Thank you for a wonderful stay! 
1850260,74590160,2016-05-16,15050732,Roma,"Llegue antes de lo previsto, pero no fue problema. La familia de Sarah me dio la bienvenida. Su hijo fue un encanto, me ayudo a subir la maleta (enorme y pesada!). Hacia mucho calor en la habitación, pero con abrir un poco la ventana, enseguida se refrescó. La cama era cómoda, y hay un gran armario donde pude guardar la maleta. Compartí el baño con otros invitados pero nunca hubo problema. El barrio está bien, un poco lejos del centro andando, pero el bus 4 o 5, a unos 5min, te deja justo en el Downtown. Hay un supermercado a unos 10minutos andando. Para desayunar no había gran cosa en la casa, a pesar de que se indique que se da el desayuno, así que puede resultar práctico para comprarse algo."
1850260,74907479,2016-05-17,56763309,Sigurjón,"Sarah was a very friendly host and helpful. The room was tidy and the bed was comfortable. The shower is a bit tricky, please ask Sarah to explain how it works unless you choose an icecold shower!"
1850260,76004307,2016-05-24,67480432,Osvaldo Ivan,Thanks for all it was excelent and clean
1850260,80880984,2016-06-20,59883,Kuang,This house is located in a neighborhood that may not be safe to walk around at night. I arrived around 10 pm and felt a little bit uncomfortable walking from the bus station to the house (5 min walk) but nothing bad happened. Sarah seemed very nice over text messages but never met her as she was working night shifts. Her young son helped me checked in and out. He seemed grumpy so I didn't feel very welcomed the whole time. Those who are sensitive to heat should know that there's a fan and a standing AC that blows cold air from the front and hot air from the back so it really didn't cool down the room. And because the room sits on the loft it was very hot.
1850260,81665112,2016-06-24,58189042,Ayodele,"Sarah was really helpful and friendly getting me to the location, however I didn't really interact with Sarah that much. The area is very Urban and it had a lot of eats and even a drug store all with in walking distance. This was a great place to help me prep for the next day. "
1850260,83146833,2016-07-01,34868756,Zwelakhe-Duma,"It's a joy to reside at Miss Sarah's lovely home once again. She's such a warm, loving, and welcoming person, it feels like I'm coming to my own family's home. My residence was great; huge, spacious, clean, and comfortable room, with plush carpeting to boot ! The neighborhood was also very comfortable and family orientated. If only we could give Miss Sarah more than 5 stars, thank you again !"
1850260,83835481,2016-07-04,33683611,Naomi,Sarah's young son was super helpful.  He offered to help with luggage which I found to be very thoughtful of him.  Minutes away from Boston downtown and street parking which was great!
1850260,87087920,2016-07-18,26387705,Jurij,I was really enjoyed my stay in Sarah's house. Nice clean room. close location to the downtown.
1850260,87317618,2016-07-19,53054329,Gerardo,"I didnt have the opportunity to meet Sarah, I met her son. The room was really clean and as described. "
1850260,87496289,2016-07-20,78192089,Briana,Sarah and her son were wonderful hosts! They made sure I had everything I needed and was comfortable in their home. The room itself was very clean.
1850260,89434899,2016-07-28,85463254,Deborah,Ms. Sarah was very nice.  Her son nice too.  The house was beautiful and our room was spacious.
1850260,91239633,2016-08-04,80487913,Omar,"Great cozy place. Sarah is a very sweet lady who's super welcoming and really makes you feel at home. The room is on the top floor of the house, opposite another room that is rented out. Bedroom is nice, complete with a nice bed, table, and a/c. The location is walking distance away from a bus station. Would highly recommend this place!"
1850260,96804564,2016-08-24,14926681,Kitty,Sarah was very friendly and welcoming.
1850260,98086549,2016-08-29,37943078,Amir,Cozy little space; a nice stay and Sarah is a kind host.
1850260,98338217,2016-08-30,62397097,Dave,Our hostess was very nice and the room and bed was wonderful! 
1850260,98355557,2016-08-30,83600059,Imre,"Good location, very nice host. Thank you."
1850260,98920979,2016-09-02,32050966,Genaro,Be aware that if you bring a car you are in danger of being towed. After my car was towed the host was unhelpful in the situation. She showed no empathy and did not help us. 
1850260,101058846,2016-09-11,91333133,Billy,Sarah was very accommodating in my altering arrival time and made sure that she was available to welcome me to the home. 
1850260,101494879,2016-09-13,3620282,Deanna,"Sarah was a very nice and hospitable host and the house is neat. Unfortunately, the neighborhood was extremely noisy. We heard police sirens and fights and people yelling in the streets throughout the night and morning. Also, when we arrived, there wasn't a sheet set - just a mattress cover and comforter. I know some people may make a bed that way, but we were not used to that. We actually left a night early because it was not what we expected. While Sarah and her house are nice, the neighborhood and style of bedding really threw us, but that may just be our impression. "
1850260,101662907,2016-09-14,94682843,David,"Very difficult to access the room up two flights of narrow, winding stairs. Very wet shower mat on the floor. The bed lacked a bottom sheet. "
1850260,102573714,2016-09-18,47847537,Shavonna,"My review is not a positive one which seems rare for Sarah's place but I didn't enjoy my stay at all. I told Sarah prior to my date of arrival that I would be getting in late. She recommended I arrive prior to 11:30PM, which I did. When I arrived, her sister opened the door, pointed inside and led me to my room, without saying a single word. When we got to the top of the stairs she pointed and said, ""Here's your room, this is the bathroom. Goodnight"" and left. Immediately upon entering my room, I realized it wasn't the room I booked online. There were two equally uncomfortable twin size beds instead of a queen size bed. I didn't know her sisters name or where she went, so I just sucked it up and slept in the room. 

It took me an hour to fall asleep because there was this awful noise outside of my door that sounded like someone continually scuffing their sneakers on a hardwood floor (I never figured out where it was coming from) Bring Earplugs! 

That same night I went to take a shower, after standing naked and confused for about 2 minutes, I finally got it to turn on only to take 90% of my shower in freezing cold water. Also, the shower is literally the size of a floor to ceiling cabinet and the shower head points at a strange angle so the water shoots out of the door unless you stand and block it. The shower was also disgusting. It looked moldy and dark and there was soap scum everywhere. 

The next day I woke up and tried to find Sarah to let her know 1. I didn't have keys/wasn't given any information 2. I was in the wrong room. When I finally did find her, she shook my hand then walked away. After standing in the foyer awkwardly, I found someone else who seemed like they lived there and asked them if I can get keys. Sarah came out from wherever she was quickly gave me the keys and told me she would switch my room.

When I got back later on that day, my stuff was moved to the right room however there was no ""wall to wall wardrobe for space to stack bags etc. or a Flat screen 32ins LED TV."" as described in the listing. More than that (I can live without TV or a wardrobe), I don't think my bed sheets were changed or washed. There was a toenail that wasn't mine in the bed, the sheets smelled like sweat, and the bed sheet wasn't a sheet. It was bed skirt fashioned as a sheet underneath the comforter. The carpet also had toenail clippings in it so I don't think it was vacuumed at all. 

This was my first AirBnB experience and it was a disappointing one. I've stayed in hostels and similar set ups before but none have been as disappointing as this one was.

1850260,106153949,2016-10-04,56018621,Leda Regina,"Quando cheguei, apesar de ter avisado antes, não tinha ninguém na casa. Estava frio e chovendo e precisei pedir a um desconhecido que ligasse para ela, que chegou meia hora ou 40 minutos mais tarde. Depois disso, tudo foi tranquilo. Elas me levaram para jantar, foram super simpáticas. "
1850260,110154261,2016-10-24,10613201,Adam,"Sarah and her whole family are a very nice, kind and hospitable hosts. You got a problem, don’t hesitate to ask someone, I’m sure they will sort it out. Read the listing’s description it’s quite detailed.
The neighborhood is average noisy, but rather quiet in the night. Dudley square is a short walk away, public transport and eateries available there. Downtown is 30-45 mins away by public transport. Next best supermarket seems to be Tropical foods at Melinea / Shawmut.
The room is well sized, the bed is fine. WIFI is fine. Having washer and dryer access is great for a longer stay.
Bathroom upstairs is a bit simple compared to the one on the pictures, but does the job. Those pictures are not of the upstairs bathroom. Some basics are given, like shampoo, bodywash. There is a hairdryer also.
There is a small fridge and microwave on the same floor, those are not on the pictures.

1850260,137453770,2017-03-15,58533306,Naiwei,"A very nice stay here. Due to the weather (blizzard snow storm) my airline delayed for the whole night, but Sarah had done her best to keep connected with me. Parking here is easy comparing with other parts of Boston downtown so that you can rent a car if you like. The son of her is also very nice and kind offering me some fruits and other stuff. Very nice place to stay."
1850260,138011284,2017-03-18,99557084,Nicholas,Very nice place to stay
1850260,138367956,2017-03-19,118895246,Jerome,"It is a room for up to three persons, not four (one queen size bed and a one-person air mattress)!"
1850260,142814062,2017-04-09,60291429,Bruno,Great place to stay!
1850260,145509278,2017-04-18,35692719,Alexsandro,"Muito limpo o local,  bem localizado.  Sarah muito simpática.  "
1850260,149134725,2017-05-02,21660447,Maureen,"I got to to house pretty late (about 10pm). Sarah greeted me showed my room and gave me set of keys. I slept in the room with queen size bed. Sarah was very accessible blending with her busy work schedule. I used the kitchen each morning for breakfast and cleaned up after myself as requested in the the listing.   While the stairs up to the third floor are narrower than a normal staircase, they were well lit with room to carry a suitcase. There is a small fridge and microwave in hallway just outside bedrooms which is nice.  At some times one would hear emergency vehicles somewhere but that would go away.  Parking on the street was easy to find a spot. I just left car there and took bus from Dudley Station saving $$$ parking fee at Boston hospital"
1850260,151619959,2017-05-13,127673291,Lauren,Sarah was very sweet and I enjoyed staying with her! 
1850260,153047709,2017-05-19,14616765,Jarvis,I would not recommending staying at this place; the host did not take time to ensure the bathroom was clean. The room was well-furnished but completely unbearable in hot weather - the AC did not work as advertised. The host did not create a welcoming environment.
1850260,155752607,2017-05-28,67376082,Joshua,No complaints. Everything was very comfortable.
1850260,161059193,2017-06-16,66457829,Bill,Room/house was nice nice and communication was great. Parking was very easy and free. Only negative is room was pretty hot and room ac didn't work well enough to cool it down. 
1850260,163885652,2017-06-25,76757238,Julia,"Sarah is a very niche host! She was all the time trying to make me, my husband and my friends comfortable at her place. Since it was too hot in Boston during our stay, she checked on us to be sure that the air conditioner was working fine in our room. She let us leave our bags at her place the last day. The bus station is nearby Sarah's place so it is easy to move around. It takes like an our by public transportation to get to the airport and maybe 40 minutes to down-town."
1850260,164768587,2017-06-29,85218519,Brenna,Great stay!
1850260,165677673,2017-07-01,85414846,Andrew,"Good location, not far from the city center. Sarah was very nice and very communicative. Room is on the third floor so it got a bit hot up there, but there was an AC unit that cooled the room down."
1850260,171039911,2017-07-16,8093838,Kate,"Sarah was a lovely host and responded quickly. We went to a show in the Theater District, ubered in and back without any problems. Sarah's room was clean and efficient. She was friendly and very kind."
1850260,180519755,2017-08-10,94225428,Manob Jyoti,Its a nice place to stay.
1850260,183571859,2017-08-17,62216328,Sara,Sarah has been a great host. The location is very convenient in Boston as there is a bus station 5 minutes walk from the house. Great and big room with aircon and the bathroom was very clean.  I will definitely stay in Sarah's house next time in Boston.
1850260,190236723,2017-09-03,11374528,Lan,"I was at a conference at the Sheraton and it was an easy $7 ride from Sarah's house.  The perfect escape from conference craziness!  I was only there for two nights.  The house is large, newly refurbished with lots of room, but I hardly ran into anyone."
1850260,191751039,2017-09-08,924907,Will,This is located in a neighborhood of Boston known for gang activity and drugs. There is a method one clinic right down the street. I heard police sirens every night. The Street this house is located on is gentrifying but the neighborhood as a whole has something to be desired. I guess you will get what you pay for.
1850260,192033197,2017-09-09,4243743,Oscar,"Clean, easy check-in, big TV, professional and polite co-host (the host’s son). Great value!"
1850260,193194480,2017-09-12,147202822,Mary,Very quiet home. Lovely yard. Lots of privacy.
1850260,193708163,2017-09-14,146703019,Hiroyuki,Close to Downtown area. A nice place to stay. Thank you.
1850260,194876056,2017-09-17,64988633,Yvonne,"The bed was very comfortable and the room clean. Nice to have a TV there. Room a little warm given it's on the top floor of a 3 story house, but air conditioning in window helped. Bathroom on 3rd floor also added to bit of privacy. 
It was nice to be able to park behind the house. 
Very short walk to bus depot that had lots of easy transport connections to get around in Boston. Buy a Charlie card from a train station - helps reduce public transport costs and helps with transfers between bus/train etc. 
Very pleasant stay and would stay with Sarah and her family again!"
2828803,16234463,2014-07-23,16571608,Joanna & Luke,"After a long and hot journey from NYC, we arrived at Lyndsay's beautiful home to a warm and friendly welcome and a cool and fresh room. Her home is immaculate and charming, and is extremely conveniently located: a five minute walk to the station, which is just a couple of stops from town or a quick shuttle bus to the airport terminals, depending on what you need. 
Lyndsay is an excellent host. She is open and friendly, helpful and informative, and provided us with coffee, bottled water, clean towels, and a basket of toiletries. 
The room is delightful, so fresh and cosy. There is also a private patio out the back, which was lovely to sit on at any time. 
We highly recommend Lyndsay. Staying with her was a great way to end our three-week trip round the USA!"
2828803,16261221,2014-07-24,18755637,Paul,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

She even prepared a little basket full of beauty products for us....we had a great time!!!! The place is close to everything, subway...."
2828803,16938091,2014-08-04,14263275,Jennifer,"Super alternative zu teurem Hotel. Sehr nah am Flughafen und perfekt für eine Nacht, um am nächsten Tag weiter zu reisen. Die Gastgeberin war bei unserem Besuch leider nicht da, aber ihre Mitbewohnerin hat uns alles gezeigt und herzlich begrüßt. Das Apartment ist gemütlich eingerichtet. Perfekt um nach einem langen Flug zu entspannen und sich zu erholen bevor es weiter geht. Vom Flughafen geht ein Bus fast zum Apartment. Mann muss dann noch ca 5min laufen. Lyndsay war so nett uns den weg vom Flughafen genau zu schildern. Persönlich würde ich jedoch nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit ein Taxi empfehlen, da es in einem Viertel liegt das nicht ganz so sicher wirkte. Tagsüber ist es kein Problem. "
2828803,17074834,2014-08-06,866343,Courtney,"We just returned from Boston. Had an incredible time and couldn't have been happier with our airbnb experience with Lyndsay. The place was incredibly nice, clean and cozy. The host Lyndsay was incredibly kind, helpful and accommodating. The location was very easy to get access the subway into the city. Such a great time exploring from this location. I would definitely go back again!!!"
2828803,17116131,2014-08-07,7402542,Nathan,"Lyndsay was a terrific host! She was prompt and friendly in her communication before we arrived and was at home to welcome us when we got to town. She had plenty of great recommendations for food/drinks/sites. She also made it a breeze to come and go on our own schedule. The place is even better than the photos and is decorated in a rustic/chic northeastern beach theme that made it tough to want to leave in the mornings. Speaking of mornings, there's Kuerig coffee available as well. Lastly, her location is really tough to beat - if you fly in to BOS, she's a 15 min walk at most and you pass through a T subway station along the way, making it easy to explore the rest of Boston. We would absolutely stay with Lyndsay again!"
2828803,17169792,2014-08-08,14092697,Jim,"Nice apartment, very homey, plenty of space.  Lyndsay made it easy for us and it was exactly what we were looking for."
2828803,17385040,2014-08-11,18740716,Valérie,"Although I didn't get to meet Lyndsay, me and my boyfriend felt at home in her apartment and everything was easy. The room and the whole apartment are BEAUTIFUL and the decoration is very homey and original. The bed is very comfortable, more than hotel bed, in my opinion. It was nice to have access to the patio area (little yard with a table and chairs and garden) directly and exclusively from our room.
The location is great: it's easy to get to from the airport and from the subway station, and the neighbourhood is lovely. It's a very Latino area, with little markets and mexican/south american restaurants everywhere. I actually enjoyed visiting East Boston as much as downtown Boston!
I would come back anytime:)"
2828803,17546860,2014-08-13,18576876,Roberto,"Lyndsay è una meravigliosa padrona di casa. L'appartamento è molto carino, vicinissimo alla metro."
2828803,17654595,2014-08-15,17070009,Adrian,"We loved staying at Lyndsay's although it was just for one night. The bedroom is big and nice and the house is beautifully decorated. It's well communicated, perfect for tourism!"
2828803,18015383,2014-08-20,14130773,Pablo Henrique,"We fell in love with the place. We loved the bedroom, the decoration, the private entrance using the backdoor, our host, the host's friend,... And the list goes on. 
Lindsay gave my girlfriend and I lots of privacy and always helped us find good places to visit and to have a good meal. We loved the Mexican restaurant! Best meal I had in Boston and it was 3 minutes walk away from Lindsay's. 
The only thing that we dislike was: the blinders doesn't cover all the window. When we got there, there was and workers fixing Lindsay's doorsteps and, it they wanted (by just looking at the window), they would see us in the room. 
I had to think about something to improve Lindsay's (airbnb), and the only thing that I missed was a better Wifi signal in our room. Maybe of you could buy a Wifi repeater to expand the signal, that would be great! But that's all, Lindsay had a great place to stay. 
Or you're thinking about renting an excellent place to stay, do me a favor and rent Lindsay's place right now! 
Thank you again Lindsay!!!!"
2828803,18197184,2014-08-23,7711557,Isabelle,Lyndsay has a really beautiful place well located and on top of that she was really helpful for our visit of Boston even though we had time to talk only at our arrival.
2828803,18422276,2014-08-26,16672471,Alexey,"Lyndsay's home is truly cosy and clean. The location is also great - if you don't mind walking a few blocks, you'll find yourselves at the ""Airport"" metro station, which is connected both with the city center/harbor (2 stops to Aquarium) and with the Logan Airport (FREE bus service).  On top of that, Lyndsay is a really great person and host! Easy-going and always ready to help with advice about Boston. "
2828803,18564316,2014-08-28,5289779,Katrin,"Lyndsay's apartment is absolutely beautiful. Even though we unfortunately never met her (we arrived very later and left in the morning) she answered all my questions right away by textmessage and was very helpful. We walked from the airport subway station at nighttime, which was absolutely fine and convenient. Everything we needed was in her apartment and it was very clean there. We definitely would recommend to stay with her."
2828803,19132145,2014-09-07,18448165,Miri,It was indeed a very quiet and charming experience to stay at Lyndsay's place. She replied to messages quickly and the place was clean and comfortable. Very comfy bed. Short 5 min walk from the metro to her house. Towels and coffee were provided. Very easy going. Highly recommended.
2828803,19279712,2014-09-09,18454861,Ileen,Everything was wonderful! The apartment and the room were clean and charming and private. Lindsay was a perfect host. I highly recommend this location.

The house was cute and cozy! The house is very near the airport, just 1 train station away however the walk to the train station is about 20 minutes which is fine if you don't really have much luggage. The neighborhood is okay but cabs are very hard to find to its either you take the trsin or the bus going to downtown. Overall, my stay there was good! "
2828803,19877043,2014-09-20,4725670,Katie,Lyndsay's apartment was great - super convenient for getting too and from the airport - about a ten minute walk from the airport subway stop where you can catch a free shuttle to the airport. The apartment is in a nice quiet neighborhood in Boston with plenty of markets and corner stores within a block or two. There are plenty of restaurants within a five or ten minute walk as well - we went to Angela's Cafe 1 block away from the apt and had delicious Mexican food. Lyndsay was very responsive and adapted to our late check in / early check out times. The bedroom was clean with a very comfy bed and even had private access to the back patio. Overall our stay at Lyndsay's apt was wonderful.
2828803,21078388,2014-10-11,19004047,Karl,"We liked Lyndsay and her apartment. Her place is clean and near the ""T"". The bedroom is private and we would definitely stay there again."
2828803,21460933,2014-10-18,1852303,Carrie,"Lyndsay's place was very clean and cute.

She was very realizable,easily to reach via cell phone.

Her place  access to airport easily via subway.
Great value for your money.

2828803,21580338,2014-10-20,398856,Maria,"When my friend and I needed a place to spend the last two nights of our epic New England Road Trip, Lyndsay's apartment was a great find because our flights out of Boston Logan were so early in the morning and we didn't want to contend with a long public transportation ride.    The nearest T station to the apartment just happens to be the Airport station on the Blue line, which worked out so perfectly for us when we left this morning because we simply went through the station and hopped on the free airport shuttle bus from there to our terminal.  Also, the neighborhood of East Boston, or ""Eastie"" as the locals seem to call it, is really quite diverse and has an abundance of fantastic Mexican & Latin American food.  We went to a Mexican/Colombian spot a few blocks away and had one of the best meals I've eaten in ages!  East Boston has definitely got more of a working class vibe than other parts of the city where visitors tend to tour historic spots, but was no less interesting and I felt quite safe walking around.  We even went to mass at a Catholic church a few blocks away and truly felt like temporary locals. 

As for the apartment itself, we didn't see our hostess until after our first night in, which was no problem, as she was very responsive and accessible via messaging and set up alternate arrangements to access the space.  Her apartment is very cute and trendy.  (My friend and I are of similar age and taste and could both easily see ourselves living in a place like hers.)  The room was as described and clean and ready for us.  We both loved the little private patio out in the back, although unfortunately the weather was too cold for us to enjoy it. Just a note that the bed will accommodate two people, and appeared to be a full size, which is larger than a single, but smaller than a queen.  This wasn't really a problem for me and my pal, but may be something of note if you are looking for a bed that sleeps two and you are both tall.  Lucky for me that I am tall, but my friend is more petite, so we fit fine.

All in all, a great option if you want to check out a unique part of Boston that doesn't get a lot of tourist attention and/or wish to stay within a stone's throw of Logan Airport."
2828803,21733440,2014-10-22,12346831,Tim,I had a very short stay and arrived late but the room was great and bed so comfy. Really easy to find from the airport and a great host.
2828803,21829122,2014-10-25,5887560,Gale,"I chose this place because of its proximity to the Boston Airport--and, indeed, it took me about half an hour to get from the place to the airport--it couldn't have been much more convenient.  Furthermore, it was very easy to get from the place into downtown Boston on the subway--again, it couldn't have been more convenient.  The place itself was perfectly comfortable--it served my purposes and lived up to its description. 

However, the host had forgotten to leave the key in the mailbox, as was the plan--and it was cold and rainy.  Fortunately, Airbnb was willing to pay for me to wait out my host's return in a nearby cafe, and the host forgave me one night's rent to make up for my inconvenience--which I certainly appreciated.  I'm sure she will never forget the key again!"
2828803,22021780,2014-10-28,13779756,Kristina,"Lyndsay's place is a good one to say in (URL HIDDEN) not so far from airport,nor from metro (that is ""T"" actually in Boston).we have a great stay there,even though wifi in our room was practically absent."
2828803,22100701,2014-10-30,8022808,Inna,"Lyndsay has a very nice and quiet place. We didn't get to meet her, but she left us the instructions and both check in and check out went smooth and effortless. The location is right near the airport, which was exactly what we needed. The room was exactly as described, and the place had everything to make our short stay enjoyable.  We would recommend this place for everyone who needs to stay close to the airport."
2828803,22280865,2014-11-02,9152413,Aubrey,"Lovely flat, perfect for our one night stopover. Never met the host but she was a pleasure to deal with"
2828803,22330493,2014-11-03,22802225,Karen,"Lyndsay is a charming and nevertheless business-like hostess who is very responsive in making arrangements and welcoming guests. Stayed overnight for an early morning international flight, and the easy walk from her place to the airport shuttle made for a smooth departure. Very clean and practical accommodations. "
2828803,22422471,2014-11-05,23287676,Patrick,Lyndsay was a great host. Her place was clean and in a nice area. Parking wasn't an issue - there was plenty of street spots available. I'd definitely stay here again. 
2828803,22648963,2014-11-11,20742511,Janice,"My boyfriend and I stayed there for an extended weekend and was very happy with our room; it was clean and the bed was comfortable. We also made use of the kitchen for breakfast and it was very well-equipped.  Although we didn't see Lyndsay often due to her work schedule, she was a great host, answered any questions we had, and accommodated for our requested early check-in and late check-out time based on our flights. The location was convenient and a quick 5-8 minute walk to the T (Boston metro/subway system). I would definitely recommend this location to anyone arriving to Boston via Logan Airport."
2828803,22851550,2014-11-16,23079591,Shannon,"Lyndsay's house was very welcoming and exactly as described. She was more than accommodating and very pleasant. The neighborhood was great and offered a real Boston living experience. The train into the city is a short 5 minute walk down the street making it very convenient to get to any neighborhood in Boston. Lyndsay's house was very clean, warm and charming.  "
2828803,23071297,2014-11-22,13612851,Shailesh,"I stayed for 3 nights, and Lyndsay was such an amazing host. She made her home so welcoming, and was always available to give advice regarding where to go and what to see. The location is great, not far from the subway, not far from the airport, and really safe. But back to the place. The room was incredibly comfortable, very spacious, Lyndsay left loads of material (tour guides, maps etc.) for me to look at and borrow, and I just felt very welcome. Lyndsay was always available to talk, whether in person or via message, and was incredibly quick to respond to any queries I had. 

All in all, my stay in Boston was made that much more enjoyable by having such a great place to stay, along with such a great host."
2828803,23136401,2014-11-23,2067006,Liat,"I didn't meet Lyndsay but she was great to communicate with. On the whole the room was cozy and all I needed for my one night stay. I did sit on the couch and get covered in dog hair, which Lyndsay was very apologetic about. There was also a large stain on the carpet by the bed that should be cleaned. Overall I would recommend this place for a short stay, especially if you're on your way to/from the airport."
2828803,23389724,2014-11-30,3803953,Valdimar,"We had a restful stay during the thanksgiving weekend of 2014. Although we had access to the kitchen and the living room we did not use either. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I like the repurposed windows which were a nice rustic touch. The room has lots of light but not enough storage space. We did not travel with a lot stuff so it wasn't an issue. Yet, be aware you may have to be creative putting stuff away. The bathroom was clean and there were no issues with the plumbing or toilet. The apartment is near Logan International airport and local transportation. Also, very QUIET! Key pick up was simple and the house rules for the most part were clear. Thank you Lyndsay for your hospitality."
2828803,24269247,2014-12-24,23583726,Lily,"Lindsay was very warm and welcoming. The place was just like how it's been described, very cozy,  quiet and clean. I am glad to have stayed here for my first time ever Airbnb experience.
"
2828803,27733622,2015-03-10,5691359,Lu,"The place is exactly as described. Very spacious, comfortable, and clean room. Easy to find. Very close to the airport. We didn't meet Lyndsay because of our opposite schedules, but she communicated with us throughout the process. Great experience!"
2828803,27942502,2015-03-15,26874446,Ronja,"We went to Boston for a Weekendtrip and stayed in Lyndsays Apartment. It was our first airbnb experience and we really loved it. A cozy and comfortable apartment, we loved our room! I would recommend this room to everyone who travels to Boston. 
It's located in a nice neighborhood and very close to the trainstation and the airport. "
2828803,28656485,2015-03-28,19113570,Miriam,"We stayed for 4 days at Lyndsays apartment and we had a great time. It was easy to communicate with Lyndsay and we had a warm welcome. The apartment is very spacious, clean, comfortable and very nicely furnished.
The flat is located close to the airport, but you can also reach the local train station in a few minutes as well.
The neighborhood is quiet and there are also a few markets for beverages and groceries. Just around the corner is Angela's Cafe with authentic mexican food.
We can absolutely recommend a stay at Lyndsays apartment."
2828803,29053851,2015-04-03,27017925,Niraj,"I couldn't have picked a better place to stay for my first airbnb experience. Lyndsay is a perfect host. She was very responsive to all my questions despite working long hours. Her apartment has a lot of character and is maintained well. From the welcoming note to being flexible to accomodate my needs, Lyndsay made sure that I had a pleasant experience. "
2828803,29252558,2015-04-06,16152528,Martha,"Lyndsay was readily available and made it possible for us to get into her apt even though she wasn't home yet. We didn't get to meet face to face because we were out late and she had to leave early,but we appreciated the freedom she gave us to freely come and go. This is a wonderfully easy access to Logan airport and yet we heard no airplanes at all. The room was cozy and her apartment adorable. The neighborhood was a bit unnerving because of all the litter everywhere, but we didn't feel unsafe and there are three neighborhood groceries on the walk between the T stop and her home. Very convenient.  Thanks Lyndsay for the quick stay."
2828803,29657135,2015-04-11,25128483,Susan,"Lyndsey respected our privacy a lot, we barely saw her until the last day. She is very nice. Her place is quite and safe.  It`s very convenient to airport."
2828803,29871682,2015-04-13,29345287,Esther,"My e-mail exchanges with Lyndsay were quite friendly, and check-in went as arranged. Although we did not see Lyndsay during our stay, she left coffee for us and had nice touches in the room--magazines, local brochures, iron--none of which we used due to the shortness of our visit. The room and shared spaces were clean and inviting, just like the pictures. Easy access to Logan. The neighborhood seemed safe and diverse, with a variety of shops, stores and restaurants within a few blocks. A few people and small dogs were around their homes when we arrived about 7pm. By 9pm, all was quiet--no neighbor, dog or plane noises. We slept well in the comfortable bed with the soft sheets, warm comforter and great pillows. We left about 6am as the neighborhood was waking up, well rested for our return home."
2828803,30373517,2015-04-21,20805619,Joe,"Lyndsay is very personable and made me feel welcome into her home right from the start. I spent most of my time out seeing the sights of Boston, and she gave me some great suggestions on places to go for a delicious meal.  Her East Boston location is literally a 5 minute walk from the Airport T Station, very convenient to get into  the city by subway.  Her home is in a working class neighborhood, an ethnically diverse population, but I felt very safe and it was quiet and peaceful during my stay there. I slept well every night even with some airport noise, but the room is very comfortable. I highly recommend her space for those who want a convenient room and warm inviting accommodations."
2828803,30605078,2015-04-25,7993328,Gabriela,"Lyndsay´s place was adorable and the room was in deed charming. Lyndsay is a terrific host, she was very helpful with directions to take the train and get to some places I wanted to visit. Everything was perfect. "
2828803,30889034,2015-04-28,20439169,Lauren,"Lyndsay was a fabulous host! Her apartment was clean, hip, and well decorated, creating a calm and relaxing space. She was friendly and helpful too. Hope to stay again!"
2828803,31090601,2015-05-02,22954827,Kelly,Lyndsay's apartment was lovely and very quiet. Parking was easy. The location was convenient. Lyndsay was very responsive by text to any questions. Thank you.
2828803,31574252,2015-05-07,19730371,Joanne,"My husband and I stayed at Lyndsay's for one night, en route to NH. Her apartment is very very convenient to the airport, as others folks have noted. And her place is in a very nice neighborhood. We walked to restaurants for dinner and for breakfast -- both family-owned places a few minutes away. The apartment itself is very clean and cozy. Even though we didn't meet Lyndsay during our stay, we felt very welcome in her home. We'd certainly stay at her place again."
2828803,31780390,2015-05-10,20922057,Olga,"Great clean cozy apartment close to the airport (no need to take transport), at the same time the center is easily accessible. The neighborhood is OK, seemed to be pretty safe. The room was sweet and the bed was comfortable. I had enough privacy and the communication with the host was easy. I enjoyed staying in the apartment and would recommend it in the future."
2828803,32237373,2015-05-16,28480900,Taylor,Lyndsay's home was sweet and comfortable. We didn't have a chance to meet her as she was out of town but this didn't cause any problems at all as she had made plans to let us in. We needed to spend the night as we had an early flight in the morning and Lyndsay lives so conveniently close to the airport - but it's so peaceful you wouldn't even know! Our stay was perfect. 
2828803,32746520,2015-05-21,27963289,Frank,"Enjoyable stay for my first Airb&b experience. House was just 8 minutes walk from the airport T (free shuttle from the airport) and 4 stops into the centre of Boston. Nice room, good shower and an outdoor space. Very quiet neighbourhood with a couple of corner shops. All in all I think I made a good choice in choosing Lindsay's place."
2828803,32895991,2015-05-23,670443,Kristin,"Lyndsay's apartment in East Boston is just as described - quiet and charming! My fiance and I spent one night here on the way through Boston and felt comfortable making ourselves at home. If we had needed to stay longer, the kitchen was big and clean and the living space was very charming. "
2828803,33498184,2015-05-29,28462964,Michael,"This was my first AirBnB experience. Lyndsay was a fantastic communicator via text and messaging leading up to my stay and during. Her place is 100% as described. It was so easy to get to from the airport and then the Silver line to get downtown. She also has a Keurig with coffee pods ready and had some fruit available too. I slept great,the water in the shower can get super hot which is just how I like it. The front steps are a bit on the steep side so that's something to keep in mind. I'd stay here again for sure."
2828803,33679330,2015-05-31,31222669,Allison,she was welcoming. neighborhood wasn't so good. our first experience was a little awkward as it was our first time in someone else's home.. but she was very accommodating and nice.
2828803,34020393,2015-06-03,648763,Jim,"I spent two nights here and liked the accommodation very much. It was excellent for easy in/out from Logan Airport...take free airport ""T"" Blue Line transit shuttle to the AIrport T stop..3 minutes..walk straight up Brooks six blocks (5-8 minutes), take a few steps to the left and voila.
   The ease of access was terrific. Same T stop runs a few minutes into Boston.
  Neighborhood is  nothing to cheers about, but Lyndsay's 1st floor flat is all re-modeled and very tasteful. Bed was terrific, room nice and enough room. Nice looking yard in back.
   Never met Lyndsay. She was in late and out early. WIFI was great. Didn't use TV in livingroom. Nice kitchen and very comfy place. "
2828803,34461788,2015-06-08,33390733,Andrea,"Lyndsay made us feel very welcome in her home by leaving a nice note, and having a welcoming and cleanly setup bedroom for us when we arrived. The location was great (very close to the T-Station, neighborhood felt safe), and I wouldn't hesitate to book this listing again. She allowed use of the kitchen (though we only made coffee), which is newly renovated, and the living room space is very relaxing."
2828803,34809988,2015-06-12,1710935,William,What a wonderful home. The pictures and descriptions were as described & very convenient to The T & airport. Very easy check in/out. Will stay with Lyndsay again on our next trip to Boston. 
2828803,34977232,2015-06-14,2766087,Anette,The stay here was great! Easy to find and just as descrbed. I love the historical house with the most beautiful radiators I've ever seen! I enjoyed great mexican takeout from Angela's cafe on the back yard and had a really good night sleep!
2828803,35308318,2015-06-17,32548720,Jiandong,"The room was exactly the same as described. Though it's not far away from the airport, it's really quiet. And the room is very clean. I met with the host and he is very nice. Thanks!"
2828803,35561932,2015-06-20,22953628,Gwynne,"Lyndsay was a great communicator in our planning of this trip.  Her home was warm and inviting....very charming.  She made it easy for us to find our way in on our own and even offered us food from her frig!  The neighborhood was adorable and a short walk to the ""T"".   We were able to park on street free and never needed to take our car anywhere.  I would definitely stay here again!"
2828803,35937010,2015-06-23,31966590,Bob,"Very neat and clean. Good location, close to subway. Logistics were seamless even though we did not have the pleasure of meeting Lindsay."
2828803,36192169,2015-06-26,21817031,Jennifer,"The whole place was decorated so wonderfully and was so clean. We really felt at home. Lyndsay was super friendly when we met her, and also very responsive to questions before our arrival. It was a perfect place to stay just before an early flight from Logan!"
2828803,36530872,2015-06-29,23640983,Sihui,Met Lyndsay and she's very welcoming. She replies email promptly and made sure we have keys to the house even before the stipulated check-in hours. Her house is true to what you see on this page and I really love the deco of the house. Such good taste! There's a lovely cafe right conveniently located behind her place and I recommend it for breakfast. Airport station is also a few blocks down accessible by walking. The neighbourhood could get a little unsafe very late at night (like 3am) as we heard police cars in the wee hours due to a commotion that happened.  But it's not a big issue as long as you don't stay out too late.
2828803,37167305,2015-07-05,33440525,Ashley,"We loved our stay! Everything was as described and it was a very charming space. Just a short walk from the train and close to the airport, which was all very convenient.  Would highly recommend this room for future renters!"
2828803,37439618,2015-07-07,6217851,Maureen,We did not meet Lyndsay and were only in the apartment for a brief nights sleep between flights from London to Seattle.  Lyndsay's  apartment provided the airport proximity we needed and the room and apartment were comfortable and as described.  We took a short taxi ride from the airport and in the morning found directions to walk about six blocks to the free bus that took us back to the airport. We recommend Lyndsay's apartment if you are looking for access to the airport. 
2828803,37985057,2015-07-12,6658602,Theresa,"Lyndsay's place was easy to get to since it was only 5 minutes from the airport. She accommodated an early check-in and made my stay very comfortable and easy. Her place is adorable and she was very welcoming. She was in and out with just a quick hello, but made herself available to me should I have needed anything more tha what was available. There was even a great restaurant around the corner that I discovered was also in the most recent edition of The Improper Bostonian as one of the best restaurants in the area (the copy of which was left on my bed with a fresh towel). I highly recommend staying here on your next trip to Boston. "
2828803,38396575,2015-07-15,34363701,Daniel,"We had a wonderful stay at Lyndsay's apartment!
The location is great for anyone visiting Boston. It's a 5 min walk to the subway. 
Also it's located 10 min from the airport, so it's a great place to stay for anyone traveling to or from Logan. 

The apartment is beautifully decorated and really quiet. 
Lyndsay was a great host, even though she worked most of the time of our stay. 
We felt really comfortable and would recommend Lyndsay's apartment to anyone!
Thanks for hosting us!!"
2828803,38843222,2015-07-19,15971896,Emilie & Pierre,"Charmant appartement situé dans une rue très calme proche de l'aéroport Logan (à 10 minutes à pied de la station airport d'où part une navette gratuite pour l'aéroport).
L'appartement est décoré avec beaucoup de goût et très agréable.
Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de rencontrer Lyndsay en personne mais tout s'est bien passé et la salle de bain partagée n'a donc absolument pas posé problème.
Agréable petite terrasse à l'arrière de la maison en bonus.

Nous recommandons !"
2828803,39409596,2015-07-23,33455360,Daniel,Great place. Lyndsay was a great host.
2828803,40213536,2015-07-29,23957969,Stefanie,"We enjoyed our stay at Lyndsay's very much! The appartment is comfy, nicely decorated and very clean. The location is great for taking the T-train but also close to downtown by car. She always answered quickly had I any questions. I can highly recommend this place if you are in Boston! "
2828803,41108691,2015-08-04,20668354,Lee,"Lyndsay was very responsive and left everything we needed for a late-night entry to the room. We also had to sneak out early in the morning to catch a flight, and she was very accommodating! A beautiful room in an under-valued neighborhood, Lyndsay's home is beautiful and convenient! Thanks for the great stay!"
2828803,41351389,2015-08-07,30080374,Chelsea,Great space. Close to public transportation. Clean and cozy. 
2828803,42267947,2015-08-12,34734938,Becky,"Lyndsay's place is exactly as advertised. She made her Keurig machine and cups available to us in the morning, and there was room in fridge for us to keep some food. We stayed for 4 days in mid-August. We only saw Lyndsay twice over that time period. Whenever we had questions she was very prompt in responding via email.

The neighborhood looks a little rough when you first arrive, but the area has basically no crime, and you quickly realize that it is perfectly safe to come and go at any time of day or night.

Only 2 complaints: This location a bit out of the way of the tourist-y things to see in Boston (nearly everything is 40 minutes away by T if you figure in the walking and waiting for training). If you're visiting for a leisurely vacation where you're not a tight schedule, this location will do fine. If you only have 2 days to see everything, you might want to find a place closer to the city center. My other complaint is the wi-fi is nearly non-existent in the bedroom. A wi-fi extender would be great."
2828803,42566357,2015-08-14,14012758,Tom,"Patty and I were catching an early flight out of Boston and wanted to stay somewhere nearby that was affordable. Boy did we find a great room that fit that criteria to a tee.Lyndsay's apartment is in East Boston about a 5 to 10 minute drive from the airport (we had a rental car). But we found out, by actually walking to check it out, that Airport Station subway station connects with the airport shuttle system. That is a 10 minute walk from Lyndsay's,and I'm more of a limping hobbler these days, so most folks would make it in less time. So I think its great if you want easy access to the airport and public transportation.We chose to drop the car off in the morning after considering taking it the evening before, but the parking on Princeton St. didn't appear to have restrictions so we got a space and kept it. The Kelly Square Pub is 2 or 3 blocks away, we ended up having a pint or 2 there, then opted to eat there they serve an enormous bowl of clam chowder some good comfort food.But there are a few other restaurants nearby they must be good they had waiting lists. So Lyndsay's room suited us perfectly,the house was clean, our bed was really comfortable and the neighbor hood was quiet. We never met Lyndsay but we did text once or twice, she definitely conveyed friendliness. I'd do it again if I was in Boston."
2828803,42840167,2015-08-16,1405687,Rebecca,"My husband and I had a great stay at Lyndsay's apartment. Very close to the airport which was convenient for our early morning flight, and a beautiful, comfortable and quiet apartment. Did not get the opportunity to meet Lyndsay, however communication with her was easy and responses were quick. Would definitely recommend!"

Lyndsay wasn't there when I arrived but made it easy for me to get in and had everything I needed ready. And when I moderately overslept for my early morning flight, it was alright be cosas this space is so close to the airport! Great experience all around - would def stay here again/recommend to a friend.

Exactly as the pictures and very clean.
Best airbnb I have been.
"
2828803,46964247,2015-09-14,33989949,Arturo,Lindsey's place is great and just as described. There is no many things to do in the neighborhood but is really close to the airport and a 7 min walk to the subway. 
2828803,47227065,2015-09-16,34596579,Corbin,"I did not get to meet Lyndsay, but she gave me restaurant suggestions and was flexible on the check in time, very much appreciated. The room was as pictured and described, the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was in walking distance to the airport shuttle at the Blue T-station. The places was exactly what I needed, convenient to the airport and local transportation, WiFi internet a bed and a shower. I would recommend it to anyone else needing a place to stay that does not want to pay the high Boston hotel prices! "
2828803,47409410,2015-09-18,29395762,Tallinn,Great place! Really cute room. It's very close to the airport so I would recommend it for the last leg of your journey. But it is also within walking distance of the subway so you can easily get to the city. 
2828803,47777251,2015-09-21,41118019,Kelly,"Lyndsay's Quiet & Charming Space is exactly that. Her home is lovely and the bedroom/bath are cute and comfortable with all the basic accomodations you need. As a first-time visitor to Boston, I was able to find her place with no issues (thanks to GPS) and street parking was available when I arrived in the afternoon. As a single female, I felt safe walking through the neighborhood to and from the T-station, even at night. Though we never met, Lyndsay was very responsive via text/email. All in all, this space provides a great value for those visiting Boston.  I would definitely return and highly recommend!"
2828803,48053956,2015-09-22,2379330,Niousha,"Although we didn't meet Lyndsay, she was absolutely lovely with us in both communication and helping us store our luggage while away. Her home is lovely, warm and welcoming and extremely close to the airport, we actually walked, :-) There is also a great Central American and Mexican place around the corner with an  amazing breakfast menu! Highly recommend this place and Lyndsay as a host!"
2828803,48307581,2015-09-25,37740613,Kristin,"Lyndsay made me feel very welcome. Her home was exactly as described. Although I did not meet Lyndsay in person during my trip, she responded quickly to my questions. Her home is in a nice area a short drive from the airport. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. "
2828803,48941219,2015-09-29,44273635,Michael,"Just stopped by Lyndsay's place for an overnight before an early flight out. Sure, Lyndsay's apartment is prime for airport proximity, but it is also quite charmingly put together. If you're considering a convenient, comfortable space for a weekend in Boston, this is a great choice. Lyndsay is a pleasure as well. "
2828803,49820593,2015-10-06,36785751,Karen,"The place was clean, quite and cozy. Lyndsey made sure we had everything we needed and could get in easily. Our stay was short so we never ran into each other but communicated virtually. The place was an exceptional alternative to the expensive hotels that were also further away since we only needed it for a flight layover. It worked out great! 
Thanks Lyndsey"
2828803,50101863,2015-10-09,42345352,Lotus,It's a good place to stay in Boston. The room is clean and comfortable. It's very near to the airport. We didn't seen Lindsay. But she is a nice person. 
2828803,50872844,2015-10-15,5462086,Chris,Room is exactly as portrayed.  House is clean and charming.  Nice that I could walk to airport from there.  
2828803,51316929,2015-10-19,6897279,Tatianna,This place is great! My friend and I needed somewhere near the airport for a night. The place was nice and clean. Check-in was a cinch. My friend and I only briefly met Lyndsay but she was easy to talk to and amiable. Highly recommended.
2828803,51631885,2015-10-22,4555612,Marie,"Lindsay's apartment is gorgeous just as presented in the pictures. It Is very conveniently located, just a few minutes away from the airport metro station.
Communication was really good with Lindsay, she did everything to accomodate us even allowing us to check in very early.
I would certainly stay here again !"
2828803,51941067,2015-10-25,10841724,Jonno,Nice place. No obvious wifi password around was the only slight issue! 
2828803,52412347,2015-10-29,43973087,Diana,"My teen daughter and I flew into town to trek on the Freedom Trail. We used public transportation while in town and Lyndsay's place was a great location to base from. Both her home and the neighborhood were quiet and charming--just as advertised! Slept well too; the bed was comfortable. The wifi signal was not strong in our room, but the connection was fine in the kitchen/living area. Lyndsay was responsive to our questions and communication. This was our first time using airbnb and we would definitely use it again."
2828803,53635544,2015-11-10,1699500,Matthew,"Lyndsay's apartment is handsomely decorated, clean, comfortable, and extremely convenient to the metro station that services Boston's Logan Airport. Lyndsay was a great host and communication with her was terrific. Arriving after a 15-hour flight from Asia, my partner and I appreciated her flexibility in accommodating our late check-in. Our only regret was that we were unable to meet and thank Lyndsay for her hospitality in person! We would certainly stay here again and highly recommend her space."
2828803,54005713,2015-11-15,47115860,Stephanie,"Very cute and comfortable space, great after a long day of travels. Lyndsay was more than accommodating to our hectic schedule and made it easy for us to come and go as we please. Highly recommend! "
2828803,54499354,2015-11-21,20599484,Tony,"Unfortunately we didn't meet Lyndsay in person, but she responded to texts extremely fast, was easy to communicate with, set everything up for us and was so kind to accommodate our terribly late arrival (4am in the morning) due to flight delay. Very comfy room. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the pleasant stay a lot. The location is a 5min ride from airport and within walkable distance to the blue line station in a quiet residential community."
2828803,55131578,2015-11-28,45286260,Liz,"Lyndsay was a great host. She was quick to answer questions we had before the trip and made us feel welcome once we arrived, even though we didn't meet her face to face. She left homemade pumpkin bread for us and made sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. It was an easy walk  from the apartment to the airport T stop, which brought me downtown. I would highly recommend this airbnb!"
2828803,55860577,2015-12-06,23337964,Alex,Lyndsay was a fantastic host and extremely helpful! Her apartment was beautifully decorated and felt very homey. It was also conveniently located and only a few train stops away from the Downtown area.
2828803,56423385,2015-12-13,13073019,Marine,"Lindsay is a perfect host!

Its house is beautiful and decorated with great taste .
The room is very nice and you feel directly at home.

Lindsay was most accomodating and she agreed to keep some of our stuff during our trip from Boston. We are very grateful for this gesture.

We were very overload but we were able to join the free shuttle from the airport very easily and quickly .

We had a pleasant stay at Lindsay home and we warmly recommend this beautiful room and this wonderful host!"
2828803,56804129,2015-12-18,50333326,Wenlan,"Lyndsay has a lovely room. Quilt is soft and warm. It took us just several minutes to get there from the train station. It is quite convenient. Yet in my room, which is at the end of the hallway, wifi is not strong enough and you may want to turn to the living room for Internet."
2828803,58194314,2016-01-01,22169560,Laura,"Great place to stay! Comfy, exactly as described."
2828803,59079977,2016-01-06,34686943,Marcela,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Lyndsay's for a night and her place was perfect! Our room was private, clean and nicely decorated, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The apartment was also very close to Logan airport (about a 5 min drive), so it made catching an early flight convenient! Would definitely recommend it to any travelers and we would be happy to stay there again! It is a great find. "
2828803,61398399,2016-02-03,5855037,Rosamond,Nice apartment and convenient to the airport. Easy check in. Clean and quiet. Recommended
2828803,145512615,2017-04-18,91018432,Stephanie,Great place to stay. Lyndsay was always available to answer any questions/concerns.
1161210,4958643,2013-06-03,5472793,Emily,"We loved our stay with the Zhangs. We are a 28-year old couple, and their children are around our age but all off on impressive endeavors, so they treated us like family. They made a delicious Chinese feast complete with organic veggies from their garden, and we were invited to help ourselves to anything anytime. They even offered to give us rides or pick us up late at night when we went out. 
The house was sparklingly clean, spacious, and comfortable, and the room sunny and quiet. We had our own bathroom, and no one else occupied the whole floor.
A note on transportation: It is 2 minutes from the 36 bus, which is about 15 minutes to the end of the T line. It took us 40 minutes to get to downtown. Coming home at 9 PM took 1.5 hours though. The bus can be unreliable.
Nancy has a spare CharlieCard - be sure to use this as it will save you a lot of $. And leave time to get around by public transport. 
We will definitely stay here again!"
1161210,5070544,2013-06-10,2953540,Meghan & Matt,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Muching's parents' home and had a wonderful time!  They were kind, lovely people and did everything they could to make us feel very comfortable and welcome in their home.  They went above and beyond and truly opened their home and hearts to us.  We had great evenings of chatting around the dinner table late in to the night and had a warm, comfortable bed to sleep in at night.  Highly recommend staying in this lovely home!"
1161210,5107978,2013-06-12,6608577,Joon,"My experience with the Zhang's was very fun. I only stayed the first night, while my mom stayed a few nights. They welcomed us with watermelon and tea even though we arrived very late. We had a nice talk around the dinner table with the other guests soon after our arrival. The room looked exactly like the photo- very clean and tidy. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. Junzuo was kind enough to give my mom a ride to Boston College (where I was) on a rainy morning. When they visit Seattle, they will definitely be welcomed to our home."
1161210,5138675,2013-06-14,6843927,Brian,"very comfortable room with clean bath, very personable host, we enjoyed sharing stories of travel and places we have been.. nice convenient locations with restaurants nearby. "
1161210,5263456,2013-06-21,6647066,Joseph,"My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon and had a great time. They were very hospitable, the location is nice and quiet, and it's close enough to the bus stop that getting to Boston is very convenient (though it takes about 45 minutes to get downtown). Over all, a great place to stay!"
1161210,5325793,2013-06-24,6750199,Kristina,"The Zhangs were very nice hosts, they even gave us rides to the metro station, gave us a metro ticket and offered us (URL HIDDEN) was very interesting to talk to them. The room and the bathroom were nice and clean and the whole house was very comfortable. Thank you!"
1161210,5401222,2013-06-28,6771442,Edmund,Muching has a really big and nice house! Her parents were the hosts and they were friendly and helpful. We managed to eat some fried dumplings filled with vegetables grown from their own garden! Nancy always had food for us to eat when we were hungry. We were able to chat about many things at the dining table as well. Overall it was a pleasant experience in Boston.
1161210,5717555,2013-07-13,7099541,Keri,"We were greeted by the door by Muching and her mother.  They showed us around the house and made us feel very comfortable.  They took their time to answer all our questions, handed us the keys and away we went to our journey in Boston.  Overall, they were very easy to get along with, accommodating, let us use the kitchen/living room to eat and relax and make our experience very enjoyable :)  It couldn't have worked out better."
1161210,6392850,2013-08-11,6552075,Lin (林),"This is in a warm home, good place.our whole family to Boston is accompany children to summer camp, a month to live down feeling very comfortable and quiet room, such as pictures of the beautiful and tidy, home furnishing articles, the landlord also prepared a metro card traffic map, we can do some delicious food in the spacious kitchen. Our first trip to Boston, not familiar with the surrounding environment, the enthusiasm of the landlord gave us a lot of help, we are very grateful to her. The hope next time to Boston can stay here again!"
1161210,6501170,2013-08-14,6803141,Moritz And Iris,"It couldn't have been any better.
The house is big and very clean.
Muchings parents are super friendly, helpful and even invited us to share their dinner (yummi!!!).
They speak perfect English, but since my wife and her sister are from Taiwan and I speak a little Chinese, too, we communicated a lot in Chinese (Mandarin).

The nearest bus stop is not longer than 2 minutes from the house. From there you can get to the subway and then anywhere you like.

We loved it and would come again anytime!"
1161210,6570363,2013-08-17,1536130,Clare,"The house is in a quite and public-transportation-convenient neighborhood. Muching's parents are very accommodating. We had three day well-prepared breakfast, with Congee and dumplings. I'll definitely recommend it to other people!"
1161210,6631293,2013-08-19,6745294,Luciano,"Very nice stay! Her mom, Nancy is very kind and nice. The room is clean and comfortable. Definitely, we will return when we go back to Boston. We didn't use public transportation, but with car is very ease to get there and to go to downtown (~ 20min)."
1161210,7109571,2013-09-06,4462264,Brian,"I didn't end up going there or staying, but I can vouch for the host in that they helped me out after a little misunderstanding of mine resulted in my getting booked for a night I could not stay."
1161210,7144675,2013-09-08,8300542,Changming,"Very very good! I have to say this family is so nice that far beyond our expectation. Best service we have even had!! We stayed there for one night because had to take the IELTS test the next morning in the nearby Mount Ida Collage. It is the closest and cheapest place we could find to stay over, but the service was way better than that even in the hotels. Warm-hearted hosts, tidy bedroom, nice breakfast, good wifi access, friendly neighbors, safe community. Since we don’t have car and there was no bus on the weekend to the test site, the nice family drove us to the college the afternoon before the test day so that we could get familiar with the environment, and drove us early morning on the test day and even drove us to the subway station after the test. Many great thanks to their kindness and hospitality, kind of returning back home, best ever I have met. Even though it was the first time for me to stay in a home stay, I can tell their service can't be beat, recommend to check it out ! "
1161210,7223694,2013-09-11,7865588,Bouchra,Nice House And Nice stay in Boston... We appreciated our stay!!!
1161210,7312744,2013-09-15,2430640,Julie,"Oh! My! Goodness!  Muching's family, house and room were all amazing.  [Note: Muching was not there, but her mother, Nancy, and her step-father Junzuo, along with a couple of long-term renters -Charles and Jim- were.]  Nancy helped get us there when we got lost and called.  She invited us to eat dinner with them.  She's a full time teacher and cooks great food.  Charles helped us understand the bus and train system.  Jim helped us with maps and bike routes. Junzuo was extremely intelligent and interesting to talk to.  
Our bedroom and bathroom were impeccably clean.   
We had a perfect guest experience, and highly recommend this place to anyone.     We will stay here again whenever we go to Boston."
1161210,7376808,2013-09-17,7065062,Raphael,"We needed a place for just one night near Boston, in-between a weekend stay in Cape Cod and catching a flight out of Logan.  We picked the Muching's home in West Roxbury, because of location and favorable reviews, and we were delighted with our choice.  We were met at the door by Charles upon our arrival in the afternoon, who showed us to our room, and gave a tour of the house.

We had plans to go into Boston for dinner, about 30 minute drive through some beautiful parts of Boston area. We met Nancy and Junzuo upon our return later that night. They are lovely and interesting people - we are sorry we did not have more time to spend time talking with them.  They let us know that they would be leaving early in the morning, but showed us around the kitchen, and had set aside coffee and breakfast items on the counter for the morning.

Our bedroom and bed was very comfortable and private.  Our own bathroom right next door was clean and well equipped, with fresh towels and toiletries.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and felt very safe.  No problem parking our car right in front. 

Although our stay was brief, it was a very comfortable and affordable.  We would recommend their home and will stay there the next time we need a place in Boston."
1161210,7426588,2013-09-19,8799347,Wendy,"Nice house, friendly family, clean street. But it takes like 20-30 minutes to walk to the commuter rail, a little bit far, but still a good place to stay. I really had a great time with my boyfriend there!"
1161210,7468931,2013-09-21,8737800,Stan,We got a great welcome and even got picked up from the Station although as we later found out the T (undeground) and bus service are very good and once you have got your head round the way to do it it is actually fairly easy as long as you pay attention. The bus stop is about 150yards (120Meters) from the front door and you only need to remember to get of at Baker Street on the way back. It takes about 50 mins to get in or out of Boston but that should not put you off if anything it is a bonus being a bit further out. It is not a city centre flat but it is in a very nice neighberhood and everyone from the bus drivers to people we met were friendly and helpful. This is a place that makes you feel at home and the whole family are very welcoming and happy to share tips for getting around Boston and what to see. We will be back if we are in Boston again and will recommend it to any friends that go to Boston.  The room was clean and comfortable and we had access to the TV if we wanted it. The bathroom was also clean and the kitchen was as well. Breakfast was nice and simple and fruit was also available. 
1161210,7500787,2013-09-22,3621976,Stacia & Jonathan,"Very good experience through Airbnb again, thanks to the Zhang family. They were very welcoming and it was a pleasure staying at their place.

Thank you again!"
1161210,7517999,2013-09-23,8103742,Kelley,"Munching's family and friends were welcoming and pleasant.  We were only there for a short while, really just for sleeping.  The beds were comfortable and their home was easily accessible to the areas we were visiting
"
1161210,7662044,2013-09-28,8880261,Wolfgang,Very friendly and hospitable family. We enjoyed our stay very much! Everything was very clean. Internet worked very well. We highly recommend to stay in Muching's house.
1161210,7742978,2013-10-01,8134169,Christian,"My travel experience with Muching's family was simply amazing. First I went off the bus too early so I called Muching's mum for help who then immediately came to pick me up by car. Upon arrival in the house, which is absolutely clean and lovely, I was invited for dinner with the family. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, access to downtown Boston easy, though a but lengthy. Still, I would never stay anywhere else in Boston than with the Zhang family. When I came home it really felt like exactly that: coming home after a long day. There was no evening without a great conversation with one of the people in the house. One word: Fantastic!"
1161210,7786737,2013-10-02,6988317,Neshat,clean and friendly family
1161210,8130727,2013-10-17,5780116,Alexander,"I would certainly recommend this wonderful place to anyone looking for a cozy room (or two) in a calm residential area in the Greater Boston. Me and a colleague of mine stayed there in two separate rooms for about two weeks and our hosts, the Zhang family, were exceptionally friendly and hospitable. They were also very attentive to whatever requests we had and even treated us with delicious home-made food. The location is nice and safe in late hours. And if you use public transport make sure you plan enough time for a bus ride to the Forest Hills since the bus is sometimes late.

Dear hosts, I wish I could stay longer. Many nice and respectful guests to you. Thanks a lot!  

Alexander"
1161210,8227152,2013-10-21,9113886,Abhishek,"We had a great time at Muching's place. We had travelled with our son who was only 2 years old.  Since our son was a bit cranky, as most kids are when you take them out, we had our fair share of trouble trying to handle him but the Zhang family was very patient and friendly. 
I would stay with them the next time in am in Boston.

Thanks,"
1161210,8323273,2013-10-25,9503223,Stephanie,"The Zhang family made my first experience with AirBNB amazing ! They did more than make us feel at home , they were the definition of a true host. Met us at the front door and immediatly sat us down and offered us drinks. We arrived later than expected but there was no issue . The rooms offered were decorated and cozy, and te bathroom had all necessities ! They even had options for what to eat for breakfast. I couldn't be more pleased with our stay here . We hope to see them again soon! "
1161210,8426531,2013-10-30,7905030,Sally,"To call this wonderful would be an understatement. Our family of 4 stayed for 4 nights & were hosted by Muching's lovely mother.  By the end of our stay we honestly felt like family!  Nancy was incredibly generous with her time, her self and her home.  If you are a private person/group, I am sure Nancy would leave you to yourselves (if you wanted) but if you like, she is more than willing to show you around her local area and further if desired. She gave us an ""orientation"" of her suburb upon arrival to help orientate us & it was wonderful.  We immediately felt at home. She also gave us a tour of the parts we missed upon our departure.  What a woman.
Best parts:
- loving, warm Boston family
- ""t"" bus leaves from 1 min walk away & drops straight at Forrest Hills station.  I caught with stroller each day & had no problems as all T  busses are wheelchair accessible. We also found mingling with locals on the bus great & very different to normal sullen inner city public transport.
- If you hire both rooms, you have your own bathroom in the home.
- Nancy & her family helped with public travel advice, cooked us wonderful food, helped with our children (!), welcomed us for b/fast.  We were made to feel very at home.
I could not recommend enough.
"
1161210,8456320,2013-10-31,9519887,Saurabh,"Mrs. Yang was an incredible hostess. She was able make our stay easy and delightful, as well as the free Bus and Subway passes we literally did not have to pay anything to get around Boston. It was a wonderful stay and I would recommend it to everyone. Just know that the location is a bit further away from the city so it takes about a 15-20 minute bus ride to the Orange line stop and from there about a 10 minute train ride into the downtown Boston area. "
1161210,8475771,2013-11-01,9622924,Emmanuel,"Wonderful experience ! I had a stressful week and a stressful day and they welcomed and help me to get settled, they even offered to join them for dinner. I was blown away. I would go back anytime.
I felt confortable right away.

We arrive quite late and they offer us a delicius chinese dinner. We had a great talk with them and felt loke at home. We would really come back again! Thank you!
1161210,8521791,2013-11-04,5243859,Nick,"We had a very nice stay at the hosts home. They were very hospitable and provided a nice place to stay. The rooms met our needs, and the home is a nice location for easy access to Boston attractions. "
1161210,8620089,2013-11-08,9295962,Dennis,"Nancy and her husband have an extremely clean and comfortable home where you will never be a stranger but you will be a new friend. Nancy has a Hospitality Personality and welcomes you with a warm smile and makes you feel right at home.
The neighborhood is very quiet and safe and this location has easy access to routes 1 (VFW Highway), 95, 128 and all the cities and towns that make up the Boston Metro area."
1161210,8655936,2013-11-11,8255708,Kristina,"Comfortable, neat surroundings with gracious and flexible hosts.  The family was accommodating of a last-minute change to our schedule, and very welcoming of our small and inquisitive children throughout. We enjoyed conversations over breakfast as well as later in the day.  Highly recommended as a base to see Boston!"

They definitely make you feel very welcome. Additionally, they also provided breakfast :) Wonderful experience all around"
1161210,8845573,2013-11-21,9152812,Kathleen,"Wow, this booking was loaded with extras. Nancy, Muching's mother and our hostess, went out of her way to make us comfortable and accommodate our needs. We got to choose between a room with blinds or a room with dark curtains, had freedom to use most of the house, and to use the kitchen whenever we needed to. There were other perks that I won't list here, as it would be up to Nancy and her husband to offer them or not. The house is lovely, on a quiet street off a main street. They are very friendly people, but allow guests plenty of privacy as well. I highly recommend this place. "
1161210,9017201,2013-12-02,8657779,Jackie,"We had a wonderful time staying here.  The bed and room were comfortable and the breakfast was very good.  The family was very accommodating of our late arrival and when we left, was incredibly generous in making sure we got where we needed to go.  I would highly recommend staying here!"
1161210,9293675,2013-12-19,4933845,Kiran,"I had been to boston with my husband , sister and her husband in Dec. We had a wonderful time at Nancy s house. The house is very clean and well looked after and nancy and her husband ensured we had everything in place, what we might need. While they are also staying in the same house , we had our space( given we went as a family) and we had kitchen to our selves , which Nancy s husband ensured was well stocked. We spend time chatting with them and it was a pleasure as both of them ( Nancy and her husband) are wonderful people and great hosts. From convenience perspective , if you have a car, there is no parking problem , and it is a nice neighborhood and not too far from main places to visit. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone considering staying arrangements in boston."
1161210,9365904,2013-12-24,9794893,Yebin,"Awesome hosts! They provided a lot of things especially, food. 
We did enjoy our stay here great house, and clean and welcoming. Also, there was very comfortable. we had a good stay there. we will never forget! we would absolutely recommend to stay there!

Thanks for everything. :)  "
1161210,9488844,2013-12-31,8255708,Kristina,"We had a second wonderful stay-the house was neat as a pin and the Zhangs so generous!, thanks again!"
1161210,9567400,2014-01-02,5392238,Dan,"Although we didn't get to meet the family, their tenant Jim was very helpful and kind. The house is well equipped with toiletries, breakfast, very clean and cultured. The house is a bit far from downtown Boston, but if you are visiting Wellesley and exploring Roxbury, it is a very good location. They are near a local cafe that is called Rox. This cafe have an amazing brunch menu.  

"
1161210,9772506,2014-01-09,10053296,Eli,"I absolutely recommend staying here.  The hosts were incredibly helpful and generous:  they invited me to eat dinner and breakfast with them every day, and they offered to give me a transit pass when I was planning to go into Boston.  I had nothing but a positive experience, and I would definitely stay there again."
1161210,9852396,2014-01-14,10165700,Yizhou,The host family is incredibly awesome. They cooked our breakfast and a warm welcoming dinner.  And the house is close to bus station. It's an unforgettable experience. Absolutely love it.
1161210,9882389,2014-01-16,11086254,Sudhir,It was very nice to stay with Nancy and her husband (sorry forgot his name). Both are very cooperative and helpful. I fully satisfied with their arrangement. Thank you again for nice stay. 
1161210,10054103,2014-01-27,2730157,Caitlin,Very nice family - met Muching's husband and son. They were very welcoming and accommodating - flexible with a late check in and check out. Offered breakfast food/drinks. House near river and parks as well. 
1161210,10309348,2014-02-12,10735973,Weidong,The host family was nice! We had a wonderful vacation. We highly recommend the place for your next vacation spot.
1161210,10507804,2014-02-22,6336728,Jamie,"Muching's mother was my host for my stay and I cannot express how welcoming she made her home, but I'll try.

She invited me to dinner with her family and they were all very conversational and we easily found similar points of interest that kept our conversation rolling for hours. She also recognized when I was feeling ""less social"" and wasn't intrusive in any way. The room was simple, clean, and comfortable and there was plenty of room for me to grind out a few work tasks during my stay. Through her experiences both from her children and with her guests she has an abundance of perspective and interesting conversation to share and I'd highly recommend having a chat over a cup of tea (she has an arsenal to choose from!). 

Thank you thank you thank you again for my wonderful stay.

Jamie"
1161210,10643026,2014-03-01,9583289,Pamela,"My son and I stayed here, using both rooms, and we had a pleasant stay.  The hosts were friendly, the place was clean, comfortable and quiet (got a good night's sleep!)   They made sure we had everything we needed.  Would recommend!"

1161210,10908982,2014-03-12,12459331,Chang,This is a really nice and clean place to stay if you're going to Boston. And the host and hostess will make you feel at home!
1161210,10942430,2014-03-14,11633891,Weiyong,"Ms. Yang and her husmand were very nice,she drove us from subway station. And the house is nice too, all thing are prepared."
1161210,10986231,2014-03-16,12517418,Kyle,Nancy and her husband were very hospitable. They were willing to help out in any way they could. It was a pleasant stay.
1161210,11073518,2014-03-19,7798091,Yixian,The most home away from home experience. Ms Yang and her bus and are extremely friendly and hospitable. They picked up from the airport and offered to send us to the nearest subway station. We were invited to have dinner with them every night as well as breakfast. The room is clean and cozy with a spacious bath. Can't wait to go back there!
1161210,11104521,2014-03-20,13197613,Sebastian,"The rooms were everything we expected them to be. The house was incredibly clean, the temperature warm and cozy, and our hostess was very nice. There was everything you would expect from a BnB. The breakfast was great, and the house was conveniently located close to the bus station that takes you to the subway. It's less than an hour ride to downtown Boston, and the quite at night was appreciated. We didn't have to worry about anything and our hostess went to great lengths to make our stay as pleasant as possible. I highly recommend it. "
1161210,11190608,2014-03-24,12812170,Susan,"The hosts, Nancy and her husband, were so wonderful. They were always eager to assist us in anything and we had the opportunity to enjoy both their cooking for breakfast. We also met Charles, their relative, who was equally as helpful. No one was intrusive at all. The hosts were also great for conversation, especially Nancy's husband who was super nice and served us these sesame buns that we will never forget. They're also REALLY clean...I didn't find a speck of dust or crumb unless it was caused by me."
1161210,11327812,2014-03-30,7708486,Li,"Ms Yang and her husband are the best airbnb hosts I have ever met. They are easy-going and considerate. We had very nice chatting. Ms yang picked us up when it was pretty late and windy, and drove us to the subway in the very early morning as we needed to catch early flight. Their home is very conveniently located. Bus stop is two minutes walk away, a grocery store is ten minutes walk away. When we took the bus downtown, we enjoyed the boston-style buildings. The room is exactly the same as described, very clean, warm and comfortable. I strongly recommend visitors staying in their home! "
1161210,11500684,2014-04-05,7034269,Caitlyn,"We had a wonderful, peaceful stay at Nancy's house. Everything was comfortable and clean. Breakfast was great. She and her husband were very hospitable and amenable."
1161210,11525914,2014-04-06,7291135,Marcela,"The house is really clean and nice, me and my friends loved it!! there was an amazing breakfast ready for us in the morning, the beds were nice, and the price was really good! The only problem we had was with transportation because the house is a bit far from the metro, the bus doesn't really follow the schedule and we had really big and heavy suitcases. If you have a car is an great place for there is a parking lot right in front. If you're going to use bus and metro you might have to wait a bit, but the house is so nice that I think it compensates."
1161210,11569360,2014-04-07,6505636,Kyle,"Staying with Mrs Yang and her husband was an absolute pleasure. The bedrooms and bathroom were clean and comfortable, the whole home was absolutely spotless! The house was easy to find and located in a pleasant, safe neighborhood. I would highly recommend them to anyone staying in Boston."
1161210,11619328,2014-04-09,2326946,Emily,"I'm always extremely hesitant about leaving a less than happy review, but sometimes an unhappy airbnb stay happens. I was clear with my host (Nancy) that I would arrive around 6 pm and would leave very shortly after to meet friends for dinner across town. When I arrived at the house at 5:45 I was greeted by a live-in relative (Charles) who did not know I was coming, which was very unsettling. He asked me to wait in the living room while he called Nancy but I had to insist that I be allowed to settle and unpack in my room since I was on a schedule. I was on a very quick business/personal trip, so I stayed at this house for only one night as I tried to squeeze everything into my itinerary as efficiently as possible. After he spoke on the phone with Nancy and confirmed my presence as a guest, he gave my a tour of the house and amenities. When he asked if I needed anything else I laughed, and mixed in with my regular friendly fare I told him I required only 2 things from any stay, a good nights sleep...and coffee in the morning, he shook his head in understanding. I couldn't get to sleep that night because I could hear two people engaging in a considerably loud conversation as they made other noises in the kitchen until 12:30 at night...and a printer going and going along with it in the background. I'm pretty laid back and don't require much when staying away from home since I come prepared, but I was disappointed with my experience here due to the external late night noise. But personally, the part that left the worst taste in my mouth was the next morning when I was trying to get out the door at 8:30am. Not only was there no fresh hot java flowing, but waiting for me on the counter was a pot of cold leftover coffee and a filter full of grounds...I was floored! "
1161210,11787919,2014-04-15,9683234,Thomas,"Our hosts were excellent. Very friendly people, who would do anything we asked or needed of them. Very informative whenever we asked questions about anything. Overall a very pleasant experience, and I would recommend staying here to anyone who asks."
1161210,11886131,2014-04-18,2455462,Elizabeth (And Jeff Too),"My two kids (6 & 10) stayed with Nancy and her husband for three nights during the week and found them to be lovely hosts, exceeding our expectations for a great Airbnb experience.  They were gracious at all times, very informative about their community and we had a very nice time chatting whenever we found ourselves in the kitchen together.  They engaged the kids in spirited conversation and were very generous with offers of tea, coffee, fruit and cereal for breakfast.  The rooms and bathroom were spotless and fresh and after one day with them, the kids said, ""We really love it here mommy - the people are so nice!"" "
1161210,12172180,2014-04-25,9166767,Anna,"Our stay at Nancy’s place was really very great! Nancy has a very nice, very clean, spotless house, our room was very lovely & comfy with clean private bathroom, splendid bed linen. When we arrived Nancy went away to vacation, but we were well aware about it, because Nancy had informed us about her plans beforehand. So we were met by Charles and Jim, Nancy’s downstairs neighbour. They were both very helpful, cordial & friendly. Thanks guys for your help & support. The house is located in a safe, peaceful neighbourhood, but in order to reach it you should be ready to take a bus from metro station. For us it was not a problem, because the bus followed the schedule all the time. Jim provided us with the bus schedule, so we could plan our trip from Boston Downtown to Nancy’s house very punctually. Another good news is: bus stop is two minutes walk away from Nancy’s house.  I can say with confidence it was a very pleasant experience. If I come back in Boston, I will stay here again. I would highly recommend to anyone who visits Boston to stay at Nancy’s place. "
1161210,12318727,2014-04-28,7802336,Carissa,"Three of us stayed in this lovely, spacious and clean home. Loved the accommodations (2 spacious bedrooms with comfy beds and a spacious and clean private bathroom with all you could need). Nancy and Muching are very nice. Muching was always prompt and cordial via email and I was able to meet Nancy in person and she is lovely and welcoming. 

We did have some difficulty as the hosts were not there when we arrived. Charles (a student staying with them) was in charge. No one was home when we arrived so we went for dinner and returned a few hours later. He didn't have time to prepare the rooms before we got there so we were just asked to wait in the living room. He was very nice and showed us all the amenities as well as told us where to go sight-seeing. However, we then waited 4 hours for the rooms to be prepared. He said he was washing the sheets. Finally, I told him to put the sheets that were dry on my bed (the other bed was ready by that point) so I could go to sleep, and he did. We were passing out on the couches. 

The following day Nancy returned home from her trip and everything was great. The day we left she had fresh coffee and breakfast items ready for us on the table. Nancy is a great host and her home is lovely and they have since changed their ""instant book"" policy to ""request to book"" so that this doesn't happen again. 

Thank you for your hospitality!"
1161210,12474560,2014-05-03,14691633,Todd,Good place and good people.
1161210,12878922,2014-05-13,11679734,Karen,"Lovely spacious room. Extremely close to public transport about 45 mins out of Boston Downtown, but intereting to be with locals. Tony, s pizzeria down the road great place for dinner. Nancy and her husband are very welcoming and hospitable. We had a wonderful time in Boston.

1161210,12997355,2014-05-17,11264472,建生,"我们在杨老师家渡过了非常愉快和终身难忘的五天。杨老师和她的先生小万是乐于助人、和蔼可亲和为客人考虑周全的主人。考虑到我们是老年夫妻,杨老师专门到机场接机,我们相信这是在BNB中少有的,让我们非常感动。房间干净舒适和温馨,卫生间有所需要的一切物品。住所离公交车站很近,只有几分钟的路程,换乘地铁非常方便,只需要四十多分钟就能到达市中心。杨老师还在百忙中陪我们聊天,一起吃晚歺。让我们更多地了解波士顿这座美国名城。 
只要我们再有机会来波士顿,我们一定还会选择住在这里,也真心地推荐朋友来她家享受他们的热情款待。相信我,你选择这里入住一定不会后悔。"
1161210,13352384,2014-05-26,11369837,Beate,We had a great time in Boston. Thank you so much! The rooms gave place for us four and we found everything perfectly clean. Nancy and her husband were very nice hosts and helped with every advice you can ask for. 
1161210,13507716,2014-05-29,10209568,Venus,"Our experience staying with 杨老师(Ms.Yang) and her family was very positive. Since we were unfamiliar with Boston's public transportation, she offered to pick us up from the nearest metro station. When we managed to even mess that one up (blame our horrible sense of direction), her son generously came all the way to where we were and drove us home. They also happily shared their kitchen to nurse my dad's culinary itch. On our first night, we watched TV with the family, which was like having a home away from home. There's a wide variety of choices for breakfast, and the rooms were very clean and well-managed. I would recommend them as hosts if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing place a bit outside of the city."
1161210,13539233,2014-05-30,14300386,Guohe,"房子很干净、卫生,房东亲自做早餐给我们吃,服务很贴心。"

1161210,13952910,2014-06-09,7554870,J.,My fiancee and I arrived for a two night stay. Nancy and her husband were very warm and engaging hosts. Coming from Canada (east coast) we had great conversations comparing things with her husband....who can speak a bit of French!! All aspects of this place were as documented. Breakfast was as much as you wanted!! We would highly recommend this offering.
1161210,14296944,2014-06-16,15650743,Billy,"This was a great place to stay for our first AirBnb experience! The owner is very friendly, flexible, and was very receptive to any needs we had. We had a great time getting to know him. 

The room was very clean, well-kept, and spacious. Two people slept very well on the bed and we appreciated that there were a number of outlets in the room. There was even a mini-fridge in the room where we kept drinks and fruit! 

Wifi was very reliable and speedy. We loved the sunroom - highly recommend enjoying your breakfast in there :)"
1161210,14397796,2014-06-18,15083465,Monica,"We loved our stay. Muhan is fun and welcoming.  He bought us fresh fruit, cereals, great coffee,  and snacks.  We felt completely at home."
1161210,14852347,2014-06-28,11359902,Shaun,"My stay with Muching's family will remain one of the best travel experiences of my life.  Our bedroom was furnished appropriately and every morning we had everything we needed for breakfast. Our hosts, Junzuo and Nancy were wonderful: they made us feel comfortable and welcome, and we had great conversations. They are so courteous and generous; we were treated like family and I left knowing we had become good friends. They are a great resource for local information and will have you seeing the best attractions and saving money, as Boston streets and parking fees are outrageous. They offered the use of their kitchen but more than that, they even made us dinner a few times! This a large, roomy home, and we were very comfortable. But our hosts were so kind they even woke up at 4 AM to transport us to the airport!  I highly recommend this property and host if you're considering a trip to Boston."
1161210,15387423,2014-07-08,11281056,Steve,The room and amenities were exactly as described. Communication was great.Our flight was quite late and Nancy stayed up until past midnight to welcome us. Thanks Nancy. We were very impressed with the hospitality shown to us and would definitely recommend this AIrbnb to everyone.

Il nous a un peu aidé à parler en français! une grande maison propre et agréable pas trop loin du centre ville de Boston! on a pu garer notre voiture gratuitement en face de leur maison! Ils nous ont fait découvrir  quelques petits plats chinois!  Dans  l'ensemble nous avons passé une bonne semaine! 
It was well received by Nancy and her husband. He helped us a bit to speak French! a large house clean and nice not too far from downtown Boston! we could park our car for free in front of their house! They made us discover some small Chinese dishes! Overall we had a good week!"
1161210,16537854,2014-07-29,9919949,Patrice,"Nancy and her family makes sure their guests are as comfortable as possible. No question goes unanswered. We enjoyed attention at all times. Really this family will make your stay comfortable. 
We occupied two rooms and had an en suite bathroom. It was very clean and could adjust the air conditioning in our home. In short, ideal for recovering long days of walking during the holidays conditions. An Airbnb not to be missed!"

1161210,17738051,2014-08-17,12739907,Helen,"My mom and I just returned from a 6 night stay with Nancy and Wan. This was our first AirBnB experience and it won't be the last! Our hosts went out of their way to ensure we had the best holiday possible. They picked us up at the airport, helped us get transit passes, made sure we had a good breakfast every morning and, because we were the only guests, even let us have a room each despite the fact we had only booked one room. The rooms were clean and spacious, the beds very comfortable and we had a nice sized bathroom to ourselves.
The location of Nancy and Wan's home made it very easy to access public transit. For $19 we were able to by a seven day ""Links"" pass which allowed us to ride the bus and the ""T"" (subway). Since the bus stop is only 2 or 3 minutes walk from the house it was very convenient and we were able to arrive in the heart of Boston in about 45 minutes (one bus ride and one subway ride).
Over our six days we appreciated not only the wonderful hospitality but also the great conversations shared with Nancy and Wan. If you are looking for accommodation in the Boston area, I highly recommend this home stay!"
1161210,18395270,2014-08-26,4701443,Christina,"We loved staying on Nancy's place. It was located off a primary street with lots of options for eating and shopping. It was also very convenient to Logan Airport by bus and subway. I was in Boston to fly in and out of Logan for a trip to Greece. Nancy was kind enough to let us park our car in her driveway while we were gone for a very reasonable price. The room was comfortable and she provided lots of food for breakfast. As a host myself, Nancy and I had some good conversations about airbnb, and I found a very similar style and outlook to my own hosting. The bathroom was spacious and accommodated my two daughters and me as well as a few other guests with no problem. I would definitely recommend Nancy and stay with her again if I happen to be in Boston."
1161210,18875529,2014-09-02,14540276,Yu,"我和室友是BU的留学生,学校开学前短租在杨阿姨和叔叔家里,可以说这是非常美好而幸运的开头。
阿姨和叔叔的房子整洁温馨,爱干净又贴心的阿姨为我们提供了无微不至的照顾。就屋内设施而言,能够满足一切想得到的需要,电视电脑网络洗衣机都可以与房客分享使用。而且交通便利,出门走上几步便是36路公交,转上橙线后就可以去到波士顿任意一个地方。
若只是房间的硬件条件好,也许我不至于像此刻这样心怀感恩。在和阿姨与叔叔相处的一周中,最令我感动的是阿姨和叔叔的和善热情。他们处处为我们考量,给予了我们家般的温暖与照顾。美味的家乡菜和细心的关怀,让我这个从未如此远离家乡和父母的留学生竟然没有homesick,因为他们让我觉得,在波士顿,我好像有了一个家。
阿姨和叔叔让我感受到被善意和温暖对待的幸福,感恩的心希望这份幸福可以继续传递下去。如果您选择了阿姨和叔叔,毫无疑问,您将是下一个幸福至极的人。

1161210,19864436,2014-09-20,10946409,Jenny,"This is our first experience with airbnb. It couldn't have been better.
We would mainly see Junzuo in the morning at breakfast. (Nancy's husband)There was always plenty of food and a great choice.Nothing was too much trouble. We had some great conversations at the table and Junzuo has a  really good sense of humor. Nancy works very hard and is a very good cook.
We also met up with their other long term guests; Professor Lee,Charles,and John. All of them are such lovely people. The Professor kindly took us to his place of work and showed us around.
It was a pleasure and a privilege to meet them all.
Thank you very much Junzuo and Nancy for your hospitality!  "

1161210,20243542,2014-09-26,20649395,Elva,"It's our first time using airbnb, and Muching is the best host that you can possibly expect! We have two people but forgot to request the second bed while making the reservation. Muching provided us a folded bed & another set of bedclothes just to make our stay more comfortable. The breakfast is great too! Loved the yam congee:)

The neighbourhood is quiet and safe, the house is very cloth to the bus stop, where you can take the bus to go to DT Boston.

Muching & her family put lots effort & care into taking care of their guests. My friend and I highly recommend their place, and we'd love to keep in touch with the host in the future!"

1161210,22010887,2014-10-28,12066912,Pamela,"We were accepted as one of the family and invited us to make ourselves at home. Our hosts were generous, sharing delicious home-cooked Chinese food, allowing us to cook and share our own food, providing computer access and laundry facilities. The house was spotless and our room very comfortable. Five minutes walk to bus, which took us to downtown train."

Nous avons été bien accueillies et bien renseignées par nos hôtes, charmants et disponibles qui nous ont fourni plans de bus et de métro,  cartes permettant d'acquérir des titres de transport, de la documentation et toutes les informations nécessaires à notre visite de Boston. C'est un peu éloigné du centre ville, mais le quartier est agréable et notre hôte nous a fait découvrir le Millenium park où nous avons pu nous promener sous un soleil radieux. Bref une bonne expérience et une bonne adresse."
1161210,22651687,2014-11-11,21724293,Becca,"Very welcoming people we had dinner with them several times and Nancy ' husband is brilliant he is a very very nice helpful guy.  If you need any advice for places to go Jim downstairs is very knowledgeable and helpful.
Lovely big house and very comfortable bed, room was very spacious. noise travels very loudly through the house at all hours so If you are a light sleeper you should bring ear plugs.
It took us atleast an hour to get into boston and the busses are very unreliable,  so it's a very long journey if you are using public transport, but would definitely recommend if you have a car."

地址用GPS导航很准,是一幢粉色的小楼很漂亮。门牌号在墙上注意看哦。经房东介绍这个街区是非常安全的,因为有警察住在同一街区。
进到房间里后,惊奇的发现这是一个很融合的大家庭,有中国的留学生,有驻美工作的医生,原来房东还可以做走读留学生的监护家庭。
房子周围有大超市,有BestBuy买电脑,有Apple店,有牛排店,非常方便。有WiFi,有洗衣房,热水洗澡,有中式的稀饭做早餐。

1161210,30437560,2015-04-22,13528403,Beth,Enjoyed our stay unfortunately it was quite a distance for traveling back and forth to Boston. We had to pack for the day when we left as it was a good 45 minute travel each way to each our destination.  Made for some really early mornings and late nights.Did not spend much time at the Bnb other than to sleep so didn't really get a chance to visit with hosts.

1161210,31733562,2015-05-09,22297971,Manu,"The room was very spacious and clean. A very short walk to the bus stop, but a lengthy ride into Boston that requires using both the bus and the train. The home was very close to many restaurants. Breakfast and coffee were available for us every morning. This was an overall wonderful experience in Boston! We would definitely stay here again!"

The accommodations are as advertised.The rooms were clean the house was cozy with Wi-Fi and there was ample parking in the neighborhood. Our hosts were very accommodating. Hey make sure you were comfortable, offered us traditional Chinese cuisine and coffee and breakfast in the mornings. My wife and I stayed with our 4 year-old daughter and we had plenty of room. The location is in west Roxbury and is best for suited travelers with a car. This is a great place to stay and I would recommend it without hesitation."
1161210,34417870,2015-06-08,22174554,Lensa,"Muching and her husband had good accommations and provided a variety of toiletry. The house was very clean and it felt like home. The husband did a great job of giving us a tour. Muching quickly responded to all emails leading up to the stay. It was also a great value compared to hotels during the time we visited. 
However, I was not able to get a hold of our host with the phone  number she provided to inform her we would be late. In addition, it is approximately a 30 minute ride to downtown Boston (~$24 uber ride). Otherwise, my friends and I had a lovely stay."
1161210,35313072,2015-06-17,32372756,Jim,The room was as advertised.  It was clean and well maintained.  We didn't like the shared bathroom and will be careful of that in the future.  Our host was very accommodating and helpful when we asked questions.  Our last night wasn't all that great as additional guests arrived that evening and were quite loud until 12:45 AM.
1161210,36005345,2015-06-24,29834207,Huan,"It was an amazingly lucky experience staying in Mr.Wan and Ms.Yang's house. My family not only found a feeling of home away from our home back in China, but also had so many enjoyable chatting useful advices from this couple who have been stayed in the U.S. for so many years. ( this tip is probably for Chinese guest :)) Besides, the house and rooms were clean, with sufficient living goods. Convenient position for both public transportation and driving. Five stars recommendation!"

We were tired from a long journey and tend to keep to ourselves, and after making sure we felt welcome and comfortable, the host gave us the privacy and peace we needed. "
1161210,38369553,2015-07-15,27966848,Dagmar,"After a first confusion due to an internal communication error, the host was more than welcome to show us our two wonderful, bright and clean rooms. He made us feel very welcome and appreciated and did everything he could to make it a good stay. Anything we could ask for, such as a laundry room, bathroom necessities, and even a designated breakfast area with things such as tea, coffee, cereal and bread was available for us. The rooms were very quiet and the location is close enough to Boston Downtown to be able to drive by car in 30 minutes. Highly recommended, as Wan is a very sympathetic and generous host."

It had parking, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and we were welcomed so wonderfully it was almost like staying with family! We had much in common, which led to interesting conversations over breakfast. All the facilities of the house -- kitchen, laundry, living room with TV -- were made available to us.

1161210,46650096,2015-09-12,699082,Md Hadi Shafie,"The room I got was excellent - it had good light in the morning, and wasn't cold nor warm (except the first night, because I was so tired to find the temperature control - not any fault of the host).

Munching was not around, but Nancy and her husband were excellent hosts, and her husband sat with me talking over breakfast, which they provided - cereals, milks and (awesome) Chinese biscuits. 

Make sure you call in advance just in case to make sure they're there to receive you - since I was in a conference, I forgot to call before heading there. 

Getting an Uber isn't a problem from here, but if you can't use Uber (like me, because they don't accept cash cards), then call 15 - 20 minutes in advance for a Metrocab."

We went to the Italian steakhouse around the corner, which is very good too. The location is not far from Metro station, and there is a $7 parking lot next to the station, which is good enough for us to visit downtown Boston.

Nur bei der Auswahl dieses Gastgebers hatten wir 3 Schlafzimmer für uns eingeplant, und 2 Schlafzimmer waren frei. Wir konnten das ganze Haus sonst nutzen, auch die Küche, diese jedoch war von der Sauberkeit und der Ordnung nicht dass, was wir von uns aus gewohnt waren. Die Nachbarschaft war sehr ruhig und sauber. Bosten Downtown und das Umfeld waren von hier sehr gut zu erreichen. Supermarkt und andere Geschäfte waren in nicht großer Entfernung zu finden. Es gab noch einen Mitbewohner - Jim, der uns empfangen und alles freundlich gezeigt hatte, und sonst zu einem Gespräch immer Zeit hatte. Wer eine total offene Familie sucht, ein schönes Umfeld und zu jeder Zeit kommen und gehen möchte, ist hier bestens aufgehoben. Wir bedanken uns für die schöne Zeit und freundliche Aufnahme."

This was a relaxed family atmosphere.   There was fresh fruit and cereal available for us every day.  That was a lovely treat.  We also had use of the coffee maker, plenty of tea, and fresh filtered water.  A real help. 

At the time of our stay there were 4-5 residents plus the three of us as guests.  There was only one full bathroom available and it was upstairs.    It was convenient to me since my room was upstairs but my daughter and son in law were downstairs.   Also, their room was heated only by a space heater.  It was quite cold when we were there but nothing like it would have been in the winter.   The room was also used for storing water and supplies so it was cluttered and uninviting.  

The pictures for this home are lovely but the actual situation now is more typical of a busy household.  The bedrooms are crowded with extra futons and stored items.  The public space is a bustle with cooking and business.   

Muching's parents were our hosts.   Her mom was very nice and accommodating.  "

1161210,78097243,2016-06-05,57938669,Melanie,"The host was on a business trip during our stay so we only met her husband who was very nice and waited for us to show us around the house even though we arrived late our first day. The rooms and bathrooms were nice and clean. The house is a 30 minute drive from Boston and was a very affordable price for a 4 day, 3 night stay (definitely cheaper than a hotel). We were able to access the fridge, kitchen, and water was available from a cooler. We were able to easily go in and out with own key. For the price, location, and amenities, we had a great stay = ) "
1161210,79805903,2016-06-14,25343036,小洁,"房间干净整洁,床品舒适松软,还有热腾腾的早餐和可口的小菜,使我们在异国感受了家的温暖,再次感谢!"

La maison est très propre et spacieuse. la chambre du haut est lumineuse, la climatisation est correctement réglée, ce qui donne une température de la maison agréable par ce temps très chaud. 
La place de parking se trouvant devant de la maison permet de se garer facilement. 
L'hôte a su répondre à nos questions concernant les environs à visiter, ainsi que les choses à faire.
Bon séjour, à recommander ! "
1161210,96394067,2016-08-22,9212217,Philippe,"Great, the place was perfect and our host have been very welcoming."

1161210,102071185,2016-09-16,11875868,Sandra Monica,"La habitacion no era la que aparece en la foto. Cuando llegamos habia un terrible olor a comida, y el barrio si bien seguro, no es agradable"
1161210,103101871,2016-09-20,87897171,Arun,Nancy and her husband are great hosts.. They have a clean and nice house in a very quiet neighbourhood.  Her description on the listing is very accurate..

1161210,104110624,2016-09-25,63948481,Mariano,"Nancy was a star host. She allowed us to check in early, great communication, provided us with toiletries, and gave us a great tour of the house. The neighborhood was safe and peaceful. The two rooms were well decorated, big in size, and very clean. The first floor room has a queen sided bed along with a pull out couch and the second floor room has a queen sized bed along with a sleeping-size couch. The Lyft ride from the house to Fanueil Hall was $35 for a regular 4 seat ride, which is affordable if your looking to split fares. We had a great stay with a group of five people, definitely enjoyed our stay."
1161210,105366301,2016-10-01,25271264,Yixuan,杨老师的房子非常棒!我带父母还有表哥来波士顿玩 不仅地方干净宽敞 而且杨老师还非常热情给我们准备南瓜粥和早餐 非常推荐这里!

1161210,108375294,2016-10-16,11950015,Kathleen,"This was our second time staying with this host while visiting our daughter at a nearby college, so it was a bit like coming home. Nancy accommodated our challenging travel schedule by letting us check in early in the day, and then accommodated our need to stay an extra night and add a couple more people to the reservation. The beds were comfortable, the facilities clean, and all was just right."
1161210,127211778,2017-01-16,74514641,Sonya,In a much more of an industrial area than I expected.  Basic and a bit outdated.  Was a bit disappointed.
1161210,133096467,2017-02-20,72075829,Anna,"Em's mom and dad are very friendly, outgoing and happy hosts. They cooked 2-day's breakfast for us. We enjoyed having talk with them and having wine with Mr. Wan. We drive to the city of Boston, it's very convenient from Em's place. We hope to see their lovely family again!"
1161210,134253243,2017-02-26,37535411,Andrea,Simply the best place where I have ever been so far with Airbnb (and I have seen a lot of them). Nancy and her family are incredibly welcoming and open. Never seen someone taking care of the guests are Nancy and her family did. Simply unique.
1161210,138314298,2017-03-19,18832749,Virginia,The description of this listing is accurate. We enjoyed our stay here over St. Patty's day weekend. It is a great value for your money and an excellent place to rest after exploring Boston.
1161210,140036072,2017-03-27,117045625,Sharon,I have a great experience in Nancy's place. Nancy and her family are so great and welcoming! They shared breakfast and dinner for me. It was so delicious and thankful. They are so generous. The beds were comfortable and clean! I had a great stay with her family. Highly recommended!!!
1161210,141283125,2017-04-02,63120448,Kyler,Nancy and the family were very sweet and accommodating. I was in town to visit a friend so didn't spend much time at the house but checking in and out was simple and efficient. I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in the area
1161210,142493587,2017-04-08,117834526,Amanda,"The hosts were super sweet, and we had a whole floor to ourselves. That was great for our two kids. It was very quiet and had great parking. The only thing is that our room wasn't what was pictured in the description, but we had our own bathroom and floor so that was nice. "
1161210,145316990,2017-04-17,89940771,奕奕,"不巧,我入住的第二天杨老师就出差了,只匆匆聊了一会儿,给我的印象很和蔼,很热情!杨老师家很温馨,回头客多,以前住过的小留学生放春假都愿意到杨老师家团聚,所以我儿子在杨老师家不期而遇了三个北京来留学的小留学生,玩儿得很开心!
如果自驾游,住在杨老师家很方便,还可以自己做些可口的饭菜,还有中国的卫视节目可以看!
总之,第一次住B&B的体验很棒!"
1161210,145729146,2017-04-19,64407443,Pavel,The stay was really nice and calm. It is shared space so you have to respect the residents. Would offer to couples with car or small families.
1161210,148382404,2017-04-30,126783901,David,"Nancy and Junzuo are wonderful hosts. Their home is very clean, the bed is comfortable, and it was convenient for me so close to the bus stop to get into West Roxbury. More importantly, I felt like a welcomed guest-- I ate dinner with the hosts a couple of nights and truly enjoyed getting to know them. I would unquestionably recommend this location for anyone looking to stay in this area. "
1161210,149943045,2017-05-06,76843070,Alexander,"Em and Nancy are very hospitable. Clean, organized and easy to get a hold of via phone. "
1161210,150649858,2017-05-08,116833810,Celia,The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1161210,153061017,2017-05-19,2983070,Clinton,My stay with Em was great. Everyone at the house was very friendly and helpful. House was clean and my stay here exceeded my expectations because i never stayed in a shared space and wasn't sure what to expect. Parking was never a problem and the area seemed very safe with many shops and stores nearby. I will be staying here again no doubt.
1161210,155120835,2017-05-27,27813976,Claudia,"Not the whole house, doesn't like kids, will have to share bathroom."

1161210,176255021,2017-07-30,80146211,Kedar,"We had a very comfortable stay at Nancy's place. There were four of us, and they gave us two rooms with two beds each (one of which was a sofa bed). We also had a full bath on 2nd floor and a half bath on the first to ourselves. The house is really clean and has all the basics. Nancy was very flexible with checking in, and left the door open for us as we got there late. She was up late to make sure we were all set. Would definitely recommend."
1161210,181362088,2017-08-12,140670998,Huiping,"房东杨老师热情随和,给我们准备了中式早餐,非常感谢!"

1161210,188782107,2017-08-30,127073437,宣,"杨老师和万博士的家,对于从国内初到波士顿的我们一家来说完全没有隔阂感,所在街区是波士顿最安全的地方,虽然不在市中心,但交通很方便,家附近pizza店、超市一应俱全,并有洗衣机和烘干机供我们使用,如果习惯内衣手洗,还提供晾晒的地方(这对我们刚从国内来的感觉太贴心了),总之很方便,温馨又安全的住所,非常推荐!"

8482847,49860028,2015-10-06,35299337,Enrique,"Lucille was a excelent host no words to describe her, since the first moment you like home with her hospitality. The room was big and confortable, no doubts to come back"
8482847,50147568,2015-10-09,42199956,Susan,"Lucille made us very welcome and is a lovely person. The room was just as described and the apartment is light and airy. The neighbourhood is very pleasant and quiet but just a ten-minute walk from the lively Brookline district and very convenient for the T metro. Highly recommended and excellent value. Oh, and there are wild turkeys in the garden sometimes!"
8482847,50824364,2015-10-14,24882914,Johannes,"We didn't have much contact to Lucille, but she had prepared everything for us and we were ready to go.
Parking with big vehicles could become a problem, but any regular car should fit.
The bathroom wasn't the cleanest we have ever been to, but that's allright. The bedroom itself was big enough for two and the place is comfy."
8482847,51167473,2015-10-18,1248430,Erika,"Lucille was a friendly, welcoming host.  She was flexible with check-in and checkout.  I felt very comfortable in her home, like I was staying with a friend.  The room was spacious and provided everything I needed.  The house is located a short distance from a Whole Foods and some other shops and restaurants.  The location was perfect for my stay during the Head of the Charles.  "
8482847,51656209,2015-10-22,46329214,Nikki,"Lucille was a perfect host! My friend and I came in kind of late and I had to leave early the next morning. She was extremely accommodating.  She made us both feel welcome.  If I'm ever in Boston again, Lucille's will be the first place I check into to stay. "
8482847,51853185,2015-10-24,23987282,Rana,Lucille was very easygoing and flexible and I did not have to worry about my leaving time. She was very accommodating and warm. The bathroom could have used some cleaning as well as the bedroom but as a host she was very nice.
8482847,52448324,2015-10-29,21246587,Christian,"Lucille is a nice American lady. She also offered me a parking possibility - thank you again.
 :)
The room was good. The neighborhood was silent and very good. 
5 minute walk to the Green line (Washington street)."
8482847,52869479,2015-11-02,32068985,Ch,Lucille was really nice. She made me feel welcomed. Easy checkin easy checkout. She had fruits on the table for us the whole stay. About 10-15 walks to the subway. The bathroom is a bit dirty... it needs some cleanup. The pressure for the shower faucet is very weak.
8482847,53274902,2015-11-07,36091823,Zoë,"Lucille was very welcoming and also allowed us our personal space. She left us a bowl of fruits and allowed us to use her kitchen as we pleased. The house is ~10 minutes walk from the green line T, up some hills. The room itself was spacious and bright, though it could've used some cleaning before hand. The bathroom was fine although the shower head had very weak water pressure. "
8482847,54556231,2015-11-21,40078659,J,"Lucille was a very nice hostess. Everything was as stated and she was helpful with directions around town, making sure I felt at home and had everything I needed for an enjoyable stay. I would definitely stay again. "
8482847,54988992,2015-11-27,611617,Simone And Roland,Lucille was accommodating in welcoming us. We were able to correspond with her throughout our trip with a delay in air travel and a late night arrival. She was even up late and welcomed us. Lucille is very kind.

You should definitely stay here "
8482847,70802727,2016-04-20,36565268,Kelsie,"Lucille was very accommodating with arrival and departure times. She was very pleasant and made herself available if needed but otherwise let you be. The location is in a nice area with a couple blocks walk to the green line subway. The room was as described, the place has all the basics you would need. The only issue I had was that upon arrival we were informed a two year old child also shares the space. It ended up not being a problem but I probably wouldn't have booked my vacation stay there had I known that beforehand. Overall Lucille was a very welcoming and nice host."
8482847,71197855,2016-04-24,64565952,Lori,Lucille is a gracious host and a good communicator. She takes extra steps to make sure you are comfortable by providing a dresser that includes plenty of towels and extra bedding. The shelves above have reading material and the Wifi password.  I borrowed an area map of downtown Boston that was helpful while driving . She offered parking in the neighbors driveway next door but it is hard to find at night since the house numbers are small and then there are 12 steps to her front door and another dozen steps to the private room. The room was as pictured and the bed was comfortable. This is a nice place to stay close to Boston.
8482847,73555564,2016-05-08,40858775,Floriane,"Lucille was a nice host and very accomodating with arrival and departure times. The bed was very comfortable and the access to the kitchen was convenient. She provides us some towels, blankets and wifi access. The place is in a quiet neighborhood, around 5 minutes away by walk from the T green line (metro).
Very nice place to stay!"
8482847,75575544,2016-05-22,9631554,Jk,"Lucille had a cat, and lives with a family. Its a nice place only to go crash after a long day of tourism. located in quiet suburban Brighton close to train line - easy transport to and from city. Apartment was very basic but quite dirty - needs cleaning for sure."
8482847,77591600,2016-06-02,63734495,Robert,Lucille is a very friendly and helpful host. The room was OK and the house has a nice atmosphere. There is a cat in the house and also another family with a young child. They do not always clean up as could be expected when a house is shared with other guests. The neighbourhood is quite nice and  the place is near the green line metro. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and watch the wild turkeys!
8482847,78838018,2016-06-09,45011354,Tyler,Lucille was an extremely welcoming host whose main objective is comfort and privacy. I will definitely stay again next time I'm in Boston.
8482847,80218161,2016-06-17,76167266,Lauren,This is was very convenient place to stay at for a traveling couple or a single person. We had easy access to everything we needed and we were taken care of from the moment we arrived. 
8482847,80861185,2016-06-20,7142506,Evelyn,"Such a nice host! Was a pleasure to talk to you and have breakfast in the kitchen. Close to the subway,shopping,restaurants. Clean room."

The house is in the suburb, and It take more than an hour to reach downtown by subway."
8482847,83302912,2016-07-02,60289468,Kelsey,Lucille was very nice and always willing to accommodate me. 
8482847,84089956,2016-07-05,34884056,Dylan,"Lucille was very kind and ready to welcome us when we arrived. Her cat, Alfonso was also very accommodating and sweet.  The bedroom was also attached to a balcony where we could actually see the city, since the house was sitting on the side of a hill. "
8482847,88144707,2016-07-23,80419745,莹坤,lucille is very nice and the house is wonderful.i love the house!

On the last day I  had to leave early for the airport and Lucille called a taxi for me. She got up early in the morning, helped me with the luggage down the stairs and waited until I left in the taxi for the airport.
"
8482847,92660940,2016-08-09,47836294,Zhengyuan,Lucille is so nice! I highly recommend her house with such A low price.
8482847,93093504,2016-08-11,88146427,Cristina,Lucille was very prompt with responses and very welcoming. The room is a very comfortable space with a porch area with two chairs for relaxing at the end of a long day. We were able to come and go as needed. Lucille is a wonderful host and we enjoyed talking with her over our morning coffee and tea. We would definitely stay with Lucille again!
8482847,93605969,2016-08-13,5233524,Evgeniya,"My partner and I stayed at Lucille's place during our holiday in Boston, and we greatly enjoyed our stay. Lucille was very kind to let us in on a short notice, she was very easy to communicate with along the way and made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. Our room was bright and spacious, and the entire house has an absolutely lovely rustic style to it. There is a busy street with shops, food places and a train station close nearby. The only thing to note is that the house sits on top of a hill, so if you're planning on walking and biking everywhere, like we did, make sure to pace yourself. Overall, this was a wonderful stay and would love to come back if I ever visit Boston again!"
8482847,97476159,2016-08-27,88809925,Gillian,"Lucille is a wonderful lady! We didn't get to talk much, but she was very sweet and accommodating! The room was cozy, and her house is gorgeous! Her little kitty was a cutie and I was hoping to find him more to pet him, but I didn't see him in the morning before we left! I would definitely stay here again; the area seems nice and it is not too far from things we were doing. Thanks Lucille!"
8482847,97953007,2016-08-29,18668106,Alison,Great stop to stay in Boston! Lucille was a nice and welcoming host. We could park right out front. Shared bathroom by several guests--I hope that's not a problem for you. It wasn't for us.
8482847,98120772,2016-08-29,161328,Dorothy,"Lucille is a fantastic host! She was very flexible with our check in and check out process. The room was cozy and has a little porch which we loved. It is clean and comfortable, and we absolutely love the house. It was quiet throughout the night and we were very well rested. It was a great experience!"
8482847,98361322,2016-08-30,8921403,AnneMarie,"I stayed one night at Lucille's place and did not spend much time in the house however the place is beautiful, with lots of natural light, at the top of a hill. Lucille was very pleasant and available to help us with directions, etc. The bed was super comfy and there is a cute kitty!"
8482847,100007825,2016-09-06,68610394,奕超,"I ha ve to say,this place is really fantastic,big room,warm-hearted host,quite environment....everything is the best through our jouney in U.S.I can't wait to recommand u this place!!"

8482847,102261210,2016-09-17,4419548,Sarah,"I can't say enough about Lucille or her place! The location was amazing with easy to and from the T along with all the amenities on Beacon.  Plus super close to the amazing view from the top of Summit Ave!  Lucile was accommodating and polite.  The room is amazing, especially the private porch which is great for enjoying fresh evening air and a cup of coffee in the morning.   I was made to feel welcome and at home almost instantly.  And access to storing food in the fridge was a bonus so I didn't have to eat out every night.  Lucille is also completely unobtrusive; I think she told me she was working from home one of the days I was there, but, in all honesty, you coulda fooled me.  I had no idea.  Quiet, comfortable, and in a really nice location both from a safety perspective and just for the scenic, tree-lined streets.  Amazing.

I highly recommend this location and Lucille herself.  She is a great hostess, and just a really fabulous person!"
8482847,103091832,2016-09-20,35493389,Carlos,"The room was nice and the neighborhood quiet.

The neighbourhood is very quiet and only 5 mins walk to the C Train (Green line - Washington Square station). The area near the station has markets, and places to eat, and only 20-30 mins to downtown Boston. Lucille es very nice and welcoming. Very recommendable."

8482847,148363301,2017-04-30,9565015,Richard,Basic accommodation. Clean and neat. Don't expect the Hilton. If you just want a place to sleep this it.

8482847,152831737,2017-05-18,17544720,Laura,"Lucille did not respond to our messages about the extreme filthy bathroom (really worse than you can imagine). That it happend to be so nasty is one thing (not what you would expect for around 70 dollars a night) but ignoring our messages is something to blame as well. The entire area smelled like a pethouse and therefore felt really uncomfortable. The location is okay, so if your are planning not to be around a lot it is doable but otherwise I would not recommend this place"
8482847,153926314,2017-05-22,122736969,Shibani,Lucille is very friendly and welcoming. The room was comfortable and stay was amazing. Would definitely re-visit this place.

8482847,160333318,2017-06-13,34508237,Chaundra,"Lucille's place, built in the 1900s is incredibly charming. Filled with character and all sorts of fun features you'd expect from a house of that age! We wish we could've spent more time on the balcony, but we were mostly out and about. Be aware that there is no air conditioning, but Lucille has supplied a nice window fan to help with the heat. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
8482847,161298802,2017-06-17,108870446,Sofia,"Estuvimos en la casa de Lucille solo una noche. La habitación es cómoda al igual que la cama y tiene una terraza privada con unos sillones cómodos. El baño y la cocina estaban limpios y completos. Hasta nos dejo toallas! 
La ubicación es un poco alejada del centro pero accedimos a través de un tren que nos dejó a 1 km aproximadamente. 
Lucille es una anfitriona muy amable y nos hizo sentir muy cómodos, aparte de las buenas conversaciones que tuvimos! Muy recomendable! Sin duda volveríamos! Muchas gracias Lucille!"
